how old you are Smiling    0 22 I m twenty three 23 right now Smiling wets lips And so  Interviewer  0 25 And you re running this huge company Smiling    0 27 Well it s not that big Slight smile and wetting of lips  Interviewer  0 27 You re twenty three 23 Smiling disbelief and shock in voice  Interviewer  1 00 This is why so many find this site addictive In a world with no cell phone or e mail directories Facebook has become a way to find lost friends    1 10 Right I mean it it used to be the case like short pause you d switch jobs and pause then maybe you wouldn t keep in touch with all the people right nodding you knew from that old job Just cause it was too hard Higher voice But short pause one of the things that Facebook does wets lips is it makes it really easy to just stay in touch with all these people Monotonous facial expression throughout  Interviewer  2 04 Have you changed your lifestyle Pause You don t look like you re buying really expensive clothes Questioning look looks at clothes    2 08 No Looks down to the left at his clothes I am not buying really expensive clothes No Smiling  Interviewer  2 11 Are you buying things Are you buying things that you would would be    2 14 No No Looked to the upper right I have a little like one bedroom apartment with a mattress on the floor That s the that s where I live Same monotonous expression  Interviewer  3 01 Zuckerberg no expression sniffs You seem to be replacing hesitation Larry and Sergey smiling pause as the short pause people out here who everyone s talking about  Long pause no facial expression  Interviewer  3 10 You re just staring at me    3 11 Is that a question Smiling chuckle Short quick glance to the upper right  Interviewer  3 19 his Facebook page which says he s a Harvard alum You re not a Harvard alum Smiling    3 25 That s true We don t have a setting for dropout So Both smiling chuckling  Interviewer  3 47 In his second year at Harvard he built a site where students could rate or be rate the looks of classmates through ID photos he lifted off Harvard s computers  wetting lips no expression You got into deep trouble from this little prank Smiling    4 01 Yeah Pause Well Harvard was just not happy that I was using short pause their images matter of fact monotonous expression and Smiling  Interviewer  4 05 Smiling Yeah well quick pause they said you hacked Serious expression short pause Mhm no expression Did they punish you Questioning    4 09 Yeah left eye twitches it was put on some sort of quick short glance to the upper right um half smile I don t know what you d call it um Half shaking head blinking  Interviewer  4 15 Probation Matter of fact    4 16 Sure Shaking head  Interviewer  4 38 But Mark had done code writing for some upperclassmen with a similar idea and they have filed a lawsuit Zuckerberg no expression Three 3 Harvard students are suing you Mhm Claiming that you stole their idea for Facebook    4 50 Well slight left eyebrow raise I mean we know that we didn t steal any short quick pause ideas or code So short pause we re just kind of waiting until that comes out in court Monotonous expression  Interviewer  4 57 In the lawsuit they claim that that thoughtful expression you were duplicitous Hand gestures Are you worried about it    5 02 Pause Nah Head shake I don t really spend a whole lot of my time worrying about that I mean we pause we have lawyers at the company who deal with that stuff and it s just it s not a huge hitch in breath concern Monotonous expression    5 11 I mean probably about half my time is spent on business operation type stuff  Interviewer  5 16 Despite his young age Zuckerberg seems to have made one savvy business decision after the next  Interviewer  5 43 New programs emerge daily Like Facebook Scrabble    5 47 I actually pause half smile have a couple games going on now with my grandparents Both smiling and slight laughter So they got on Facebook and we started playing Scrabble together Smiling  Interviewer  5 55 So Facebook is changing the way we communicate with our friends and with our grandparents Humor in voice pause It s also changing politics Every major candidate has a page Zuckerberg says there seem to be more Republicans on the site than Democrats and among them Barack Obama with his young persons following is hugely popular Hillary Clinton is hugely unpopular Zuckerberg no expression You know it used to be first you went on Face the Nation if you were a candidate Then short pause well you went on Letterman Now it seems that candidates have to be on Facebook Surprised pause Are you changing the way candidates are running for president Questioning look voice rises at president sounding shocked    6 32 Well I think because politicians can can communicate with short pause tens of thousands of people at the same time it s pretty effective for them in campaigning Monotonous expression  Interviewer  8 01 Zuckerberg no expression Is it true very short pause that very very short pause you don t make that much money    8 05 Lip tick facial tick I think that s a short pause pretty relative thing but I mean as a private company wets lips pause we just have the advantage of not necessarily having to report to quick pause the outside world all of our financials Monotonous expression  Interviewer  8 15 He may duck the question but there s no getting around the fact that Facebook needs to find a way to generate revenue and so Zuckerberg is experimenting with ads trying to cash in on his users own recommendations Say you write on Facebook that you like certain movie very short pause that s turned into an ad or maybe you like a scarf from Bloomingdale s    8 38 So this isn t an ad that s going to go to a lot of people Basically very short pause it when you put that information in our profile that you bought a scarf and very quick pause quick short glance to the upper right that you like that scarf Or that s something that your friends might find interesting Pause Right Um Pausing swallows loudly So what we do short pause is we might show that information to your friends a little bit more proactively wets lips short pause as an ad Right so If you were to go to Monotonous expression  Interviewer  8 59 But with me in the ad Slightly confused and concerned look    9 01 Yeah but that that would basically be slight eyebrow raise the ad  Interviewer  9 03 Okay but it s almost like pause an endorsement Like Michael pause Jordan pause for Nike Kind of a smile I become the spokesman for that ad Amazement    9 12 Well that s what you re doing when you re putting that information on your profile Monotonous expression  Interviewer  9 15 The real trouble started when they began using a tracking program called Beacon that monitors what you buy on over 40 Web sites and automatically reports it to your friends without explicit permission Zuckerberg swallowing no expression People signed up pause for Facebook short quick pause half smile eyebrow raise thinking that that it was a pause way to just stay in touch with their friends you know what I m talking about Pause Zuckerberg no expression And now some of them pause feel that that there s some excessive blinking pause snooping going on Zuckerberg swallows no expression Is there any pause concern you re turning Facebook into something much more commercial Raise eyebrows    9 47 Wets lips I actually eyebrow raise think that this makes it less commercial I mean what would you rather see A banner ad from Bloomingdale s raised harder voice or that one of your friends bought a scarf softer voice  Interviewer  10 22 Zuckerberg no expression Well I guess this shows how difficult it is pause for short pause a company like yours to make money through advertising and protect people s real privacy and their sense of privacy Expressions to emphasize words    10 35 Swallows You know it s Short quick pause It m might take some work for us to get this exactly right Stahl no expression This is something we think is going to be really good thing Monotonous expression  Interviewer  10 43 Not a real answer to the privacy question more like the canned response of a typical business executive    10 50 There have slightly stronger voice to be ads eyebrow raise either way because we have to make money Stahl focused expression I mean the pause we have 400 employees and you know I mean we we have to support all that pause and make a profit Monotonous expression  Interviewer  11 52 Zuckerberg ponders whether to take his company public this year This would be a good place to announce that Hinting and happy expression    11 59 I think what what I can announce is that it is highly unlikely that we will go public in 2008 Smiling Stahl focused And when going public makes sense to do we ll do that And maybe that s two 2 years out Maybe it s three 3 years out Monotonous expression  Interviewer  12 08 Do you think your age short pause eyebrow raise is an asset pause or a liability concerned    12 14 I mean there s probably a little bit of both right I mean deep breath wets bottom lip pause there are definitely elements of of experience and stuff that that someone who s my age wouldn t have but there are also things that that I can do that other people wouldn t necessarily be able to Monotonous expression '}\n"

      "{'filename': '2008-002', 'content': ' Sarah Lacy Everyone so I m Sarah Lacy That is not a camera and if you don t know who this guy is you should really leaving give your seat to someone in the overflow room This is of course  from Facebook   Thank you  Sarah Lacy So uh so uh there I m in a lucky position I m the lucky reporter who actually gets to ask him every obnoxious question So you know I actually feel like most of the stuff that s been written about Facebook since the news since the platform launch has been all corporate stuff it s been year 23 it s been the 15 billion valuation The core of why you guys are doing so well is the site itself and I think a lot of people have a lot of misunderstandings about the site itself and it s something we ve talked about in the past So to start up you know I just want you to talk a little bit about the role Facebook is playing in the world now and how that s evolved since it was just your Harvard project   Sure actually that s a great first place to start So so yeah I tend to agree that a lot of the focus has been on things that we as a company aren t necessarily as focused on The thing that we are trying to do at Facebook is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently and we think that this both has very subtle effects on individuals in terms of helping them build more trusting and empathy relationships and enrich their lives and it also has a really broad macro effect when when you take the sum of these connections and you put them up to something much more broad You know one example of this more recently you know we just launched internationally and um it was always kind of available for people to use but it was only in English until about a month ago We launched in Spanish for the first time on 00 02 00 February 11th  Sarah Lacy Let s hear it for Spain   And um laughter  Sarah Lacy Sorry Mark   So so one of the countries that has really taken off and has a significant Facebook population that we watch in Spanish is Columbia and and this is actually really notable because there were a few people who were using it in English before but a ton of people started signing up for it in Spanish once it was available and the first thing that people started doing was they started using the site to organize communicate and revolt against the guerrilla armies that were in Columbia  Sarah Lacy So I know just go with 00 02 43 me for a second So I know a lot of how the site has evolved has really been true to your original vision and original mission Did you ever think people would be using Facebook to revolt against the government of Colombia   Well no laughter So so it s very hard to predict these things But think about since since the beginning we kind of had a sense that if we can just help people communicate more efficiently that that would have a very profound effect It helps people on this micro area and just helping them cultivate more personal more trusting and empathy relationships with the people around them And that s a really important thing getting empathy in a world that becomes an increasingly complex place But at a broader level if you add up all those connections you actually get a very profound effect and I think that what s happening with Colombia is one example I I wouldn t have predicted that that would have happened but I think it it makes sense  Sarah Lacy What is it about Facebook though I mean because the Internet is considered very open The Internet has been connecting people and enabling communication Why do they need something like Facebook in order to enable this   Well the Internet is a great platform on top of which you build these things and there needs some specific tools that allow people to communicate very efficiently We re not the only ones doing this A lot 00 04 00 of people are doing things like this A lot of people are using our tools especially in places like Columbia and they re using it to do these types of things and just communicate really efficiently with people around them I mean there are ways people can communicate and actually people do that in real life all the time A lot of what we re doing on Facebook is not trying to build a new community What we re trying to do is help people communicate with people that they already would have just more effectively extend that empathy and extend those relationships and be able to keep in touch with more people and at the same time absorb more information and communicate better So that s really what we re trying to do  Sarah Lacy So the other day when we were talking and you were telling me the story about Facebook and terrorism which I think is interesting So I want you to talk about that because it s another example of this sort of efficient platform that you ve built being used I mean like you said it s the real world things just playing out in the web but other people s real world experience is so different than ours It s surreal to think about some of these other stories and it s a good one   Yeah so I mean I heard a story a few months ago that s absolutely unbelievable Um Facebook has a relatively large population in Lebanon and you know at this point I think people understand or have studied terrorism enough and fundamentalism to understand that it doesn t come from a deep hatred of anyone whether it be a picture of America or any picture of anyone It comes from just a lack of connectedness and a lack of communication a lack of empathy and understanding And um a lot of the people I I heard a story of some youths in Lebanon who were growing up and and  Sarah Lacy Probably not much younger than you   Not much younger than me and relatively poor and um they were growing up and they spent a lot of time with their Imam their local religious leader and basically they spent a lot of time like studying under this person because a lot of it is that they believe in their religion a lot of it is 00 06 00 just because that institution is providing them with free food free uniforms um free clothing and because they don t really have other options But I mean the people spend a lot of time doing that and on the side they ll also go out with their friends and drink on Friday night and try to meet girls and do all the things that you and I would think would be normal things out here in the west and um then during the week they re studying with their Imam Many of them are very peaceful some of them are extremists and take pictures with their students holding guns with a religious leader And um and now because of Facebook I heard a story a few months again where people were able to keep connections with a bunch of their friends who they d met who went off to Europe went off to other places and they were able to keep an understanding and broaden their horizons or their understanding of what was going on in the world And not just to increase the options that they had and it made so that they just had a broader understanding and more empathy for what was out there in the world and that really changed their outlook on a lot of things  Sarah Lacy Uh huh   So it s amazing that there are people who are at a point in their life where they re basically deciding  Sarah Lacy They re at a crossroads   Yeah am I going to  Sarah Lacy That s a lot of people crosstalk 00 07 16   Am I going to grow up to be a terrorist or am I going to go up two to do other things I mean it s really profound right Where not the only ones who are doing this We re just part of this massive trend that s going on in the Internet today with a lot of developers a lot of artists or different people who are just helping people communicate But I mean  Sarah Lacy Right   It s just very profound what will happen if you can enable these types of connections  Sarah Lacy So not just enabling it since you have such a platform are there things that you re doing proactively to do good in the world to take advantage of it   Um  Sarah Lacy As a company I mean well I guess not he s just interested in himself 50 billion   Well I think that what we are dealing as a mission is a very important thing helping people communicate more efficiently Um 00 08 00 I mean it s it s interesting when you think about a lot of the things that people think about is  Sarah Lacy  Oh it s such a laugh and stall moment 00 08 05 What   Thanks laughter  Sarah Lacy Is that a question   Thanks  Sarah Lacy I m sorry inaudible 00 08 13   See you can get away with stuff like that  Sarah Lacy Well I can think the first time I ever interviewed Mark it was so awkward We ll get back to you in a minute laughter We re in a conference room at Facebook and I d talked to him on the phone before but never met him in person and when I talked to him on the phone he was really ballsey and out there And it s just like so I was like expecting this brash punk outspoken kid but he was so nervous He was wearing a white tee shirt and it was sopping wet by the end of the interview sweating through his shirt and I just kept trying to ask broader and broader questions hoping something would just spur it and he would just open up and start talking And I kept getting more broader and broader and more frustrated and finally I asked him something I don t remember what it was and he was like he kind of does this thing you ll see it it s like head moving like a bird He said I don t know how to answer that That s too broad And I just looked I put down my notebook and I was like Mark I m trying to get you to say more than two words I don t care what you say just say more than two words Do you remember what you said   No Sarah Lacy You said That s really hard and I said Three words laughter   Yeah  Sarah Lacy But back to you   That was a good theory  Sarah Lacy For the last 15 minutes I was like I feel ya Leslie Stahl   What was the question laughter  Sarah Lacy Your mission the mission you guys are on that s what you were saying   Yeah I was talking about helping people communicate more efficiently and make connections and how that s a pretty important thing So you were asking about the inaudible 00 09 47  Sarah Lacy Yes  There are a lot of big issues in the world that need to be resolved and um as a company what we are trying to do is build an infrastructure on top of which to solve some of these problems 00 10 00 A little while ago I was having a conversation with someone who who is very involved in the ONE Campaign I don t know if you guys are familiar with It s a large organization that s very involved Their goal is to help fight poverty and raise money and awareness for different countries that have extreme poverty And one of the ways that they go about this and one of the ways that they talk about it is they want to build an organization that has enough political clout to really affect the way that legislation happens in this country and in other countries so they can achieve their end They re compared to the NRA by the way because the NRA is an incredibly powerful organization for gun rights It s very influential If you get in their way then that really affects you So their goal was to build an organization that was that powerful but for poverty and so I heard the story where my friend was telling me that there was this bill that was being voted on in terms of allowing some kind of aid to a specific country in Africa and there was a congressman who was in Illinois who thought that his constituents wouldn t want him to vote on the bill They wanted the taxpayer money to be focused locally So he turned he voted no on the bill And then he went in and gave a speech to his local constituents and he said I will make surethat none of your taxpayer money ever leaves this country and a lot of people just disagreed with that They thought No we really need to be fighting poverty here Right so what the ONE Campaign did was they went and organized support and they found all the people that were against that in this local area and they protested So everywhere this congressman went for a week when he went to church with his kids there were people outside protesting When he went to work at his office there were people outside protesting When he went home to the extent that they could there were people outside protesting 00 12 00 And um when he went to drop off his kids at school there were people outside protesting so within a week he said Look I guess I got this wrong You guys clearly want to support this Poverty is an important issue for you But the most striking thing about that is why does there need to be a big organization to channel people s voices  Sarah Lacy Right   Right so I mean we re at a point now with the Internet with a lot of these applications where communication should be efficient enough that these people should have a voice should be able to be heard without having a large organization with millions of people that have been organized and has raised millions of dollars in order to fight for a specific cause And um and I think it s an interesting thing because the world is increasingly complex and there This isn t the only issue out there there are a ton of issues and the U S isn t necessarily in the condition that it was before justto tell a lot of people in the world what they should be doing  Sarah Lacy Right   It s increasingly the case that for things like this to work there needs to be a solid base for people to communicate that s built not top down through legislation from countries but bottom up by people like us by building applications Um and one of them is Facebook but a lot of them are also being built by you guys and and I think that that s just a really important trend in the world  Sarah Lacy Yeah right   So when you asked about inaudible 00 13 26 At this point in our development we re running the business around break even We re not in it for on the money and what we re really trying to do is we re focusing on building this infrastructure on top of which people can communicate and work on these things  Sarah Lacy You know one thing that I ve observed when you compare and contrast sort of web 1 0 2 0 if you will I bet fewer big public companies come out of the 2 0a but I think these companies have far bigger social impact than buying a book online or being able to sell stuff on eBay I mean all of these companies because they re so focused on 00 14 00 community and communication and empowering people whether it s blogging you know what you guys are doing whatever it s it has a much richer impact on people s life and I think that s what we talked about these sites being addictive   Yeah I think the stuff from the first wave 00 14 17 was actually really interesting too  Sarah Lacy When you were five   When I was five Thanks Laughter You would bring it back to that  Sarah Lacy Alright so I want to talk about some other stuff but just since you touched on international I know that you guys are launching France tonight Right   Yeah where did you get that news before me  Sarah Lacy  laughter Oh oh yeah I probably should have said Sorry Are you doing something tonight   Apparently yeah We we launched in Spanish about a month ago and in German on Saturday last weekend and where launching in French tonight  Sarah Lacy So you know that s grand 00 15 05 So one thing that I ve observed is that a lot of web companies have a hard time scaling not only out of their kind of niche but internationally it s been a really hard thing You guys seem to have navigated it better than most Why do you Is there some secret to that or is it just because you guys are trying to be an efficient platform and not a media property or   Well think of the need that we re tapping into as a universal need So everyone has relationships everyone needs to communicate with people and connecting is just a fundamental human thing So even from the beginning when I just launched it at Harvard and a lot of people thought that it was just a college thing for a long time we were always very focused as a company We re helping people communicate We re helping people communicate That s a universal thing  Sarah Lacy Yeah   There can be a time when this or something like it is being used by every single person in the world Right I don t know if Facebook is going to be that thing but I can that there is going to be some platform that enables that  Sarah Lacy Well speaking of needs 00 16 00 you guys need to make money You ve got the hype you ve got all these people you ve got the evaluation so I want to talk about ad staff   Go for it  Sarah Lacy Is that cool I kind of cut you off   You don t need to ask my permission I mean I m up here on this platform and Sarah Lacy You kind of had this hurt look like I was talking Do you want to finish your thought   No that s okay  Sarah Lacy First of all before we even talk about what great innovation you guys are going to come up with and all that let s do the ad deal with Microsoft There s a sense that Google Microsoft have been going around buying up this inventory in sort of an arms race and because it s such big companies it doesn t hurt them to overpay for it but there s a sense that they re not making money off these deals because sites like Facebook My Space et cetera aren t are really monetizable um and there s been fate 00 16 48 on that Can you tell us What can you tell us about how the Microsoft deal is going Do they feel they re getting their money s worth   Well let me take a step back from that What you said at the beginning of this session is actually a really important theme I think that a lot of people have focused on some deals that we ve done the valuation all these different things and I think that what we ve talked about so far is actually at Facebook What we think of the important things the work that goes on all the time It s building a product building system that helps people communicate and connect Everything we do at the company we think about through that framework That s our mission that s what we re trying to achieve And a revenue curve if we re deciding how to build the business is the most effective way for us to go about meeting our mission and achieving the goal that we have in the world So um in terms of the Microsoft relationship that we have the way that we think about monetizing and serving our users and that way of making money is that we want the way that we make money to be in line with how people use the site So what people do on the site is they communicate information with each other they share bits of information If you look at someone s profile people always list their favorite music their favorite movies the things they re into and a lot of that is 00 18 00 very commercial But that s fine that s just people expressing their identity  Sarah Lacy Right  The monetization system that we are trying to build is one that is very organic with what people are already doing on the site  Audience The site inaudible 00 18 17   Thank you  Sarah Lacy We ll get to that in a second   We re already trying to basically help share these types of information and if we give people enough control over this although not complete control and let them share the information that they want then that s a significant overlap with the way that we think we re going to make money on the site Now with that said there s a whole other realm of background which we haven t gotten that involved with and Microsoft and Google have  Sarah Lacy And the idea is you don t want to waste your time that you want to work on the innovative things so you basically offload it right   Well we re working with them a lot and they ve been a really good partner with us on that and a bunch of other things  Sarah Lacy But just I mean this is what I m trying to get at There s a sense that yes you have this media revenue from Microsoft which is great but there s a sense that s not sustainable because that in itself isn t even that profitable So there s pressure on you guys to kind of practice larger things or in three years or whenever this deal runs out you ll have absolutely no money So before you get to the larger thing Banner has a loan 00 19 14 are they working Are they happy with the deal   I think they re very happy I mean you d have to talk to them about it I mean we are happy They seem pretty happy Go for it  Sarah Lacy They are You call want me to call Bomber 00 19 26 Give me a phone to dial   I don t and I m not going to Yeah but I m pretty sure that they re pretty happy with it As a product company were not checking stats on that but I can tell you it s going really well for both of us  Sarah Lacy So let s get to what you guys are doing I know you announced that the world of advertising is changing the most it has in 100 years or something Like that   We re part of a larger trend that people are communicating more with each other and we think that there is a way of advertising which is basically just people endorsing it  Sarah Lacy So how far along is Facebook into implementing 00 20 00 this Are you guys in the very early stages Have you figured it out Do you have the basic idea and you re trying to figure it out how it works   No and I think when we announce that we probably got a little ahead of ourselves and and we said that we had more of it figured out than we actually did I view that as kind of a mistake that we made I think that in general the theme poll 00 20 28 that we want to do is help people share information and we believe that the way that people advertise on the site and endorse things is a part of that so the economic engine behind the company and the change that we are trying to make should be driven by the same type of behaviors that people are doing on the site when they are using it normally Right that s what the best lines of information 00 20 47 are for So that s what we re trying to build With that said I think that we have a lot of change and a lot of things to build before we get there  Sarah Lacy One thing that I really respect about you guys is that you view this as a multi decade process Right Sort of like building out the social graph 00 21 07 Building out I mean this is not something that you re trying to solve next quarter next year   Yeah this is a pretty long term thing I mean this is huge We re trying to push this thing forward and we don t know which part we re going to do A lot of you guys here are developers I m sure A lot of you also are playing a very instrumental role in the trends that are playing out It s going to be interesting to watch this unfold in the next 10 to 15 to 20 years  Sarah Lacy So let s talk about Beacon   So for it  Sarah Lacy WTF So first of all tell us what you wanted to communicate with Beacon and what your vision was and let s all have an open mind and listen and then we ll talk a little bit about what you think you guys did wrong   Sure So I think that the primary thing that we were trying to do is well I have to backup a second 00 22 00 In our company Beacon isn t even a part of the ad team It s a part of our platform team And there s this trend where we think that these social networks and social services are going from being large monolithic sites like facebook com or another large social networking site to a collection of social services Right which some of them are ones which we have developed or which we think are important like Newsfeed or profiles inbox the ability to communicate to search for things A lot of them in increasing number are things that were not fulfilling largely because we know that our DNA as a company isn t set to develop a lot of these things and even if it were we can get to them and other people are more talented and have more focus in different areas So an increasing number of the social services that are out what we have tried to do in order to build out this ecosystem and reach our goal of helping everyone connect and communicate really efficiently is we tried to build a platform that allows other people to build these services And some of those are going to be inside facebook com and that s a lot of the development that s going on today and an increasing amount of that is going to be outside of facebook com in the rest of the web using having access to people s information as they want to share it and being able to push information back to their friends as people want to share and do that And that s going to be an increasingly important part of the ecosystem So what we were trying to do with Beacon was really just take the first step and to let people take actions in other parts of the web and share it back with their friends on Facebook It also ties into the ad system in what I was just talking about in that what we want to do with our ad system is have something that fits very organically into what people are already going on our site People are sharing information and if that can be used in endorsements that people agree to then that can be a very effective ad system The performance of those ads mean they re trusted Someone actually cared about or said they wanted to use something It fits way better and that s what people are coming to our site to do to learn what s going on with their friends and communicate But we view it as a very important 00 24 00 trend in the world for these social services to distribute out and for an increasing amount of this to happen outside our walls or outside facebook com and that s really what the first generation of Beacon was really trying to get that I think we made a lot of mistakes both in how we communicated it and just some interface things We probably did not make it as clear as we should have and we re learning as a company We re relatively new still and trying to figure some stuff out  Sarah Lacy I think it s interesting to compare and contrast what happened with Beacon with what happened with the Newsfeed because I think that the uproar over Newsfeed a much bigger thing than actually threatened your company and threatened the community than the Beacon thing and the Beacon thing let s face it was really a small percentage of users that were upset about it I use Facebook a lot and I ve seen one Beacon It s not something that really impacts your experience that much whereas the Newsfeed people really got upset In both cases there were cases where it was something that you felt was so integral to the site and so integral to your vision that had something about privacy concerning people about privacy I mean is there something about this bigger vision of where Facebook is going that naturally conflicts with privacy Is this something that s going to keep cropping up for you guys   The thing that s really important is that we need to give people complete control over their information People need to be able to say exactly who they want to share each piece of information that they re sharing who they want a share it with I think that naturally involves a lot more sharing For example cell phone numbers I think the most recent number is something like 20 or 25 percent of people on Facebook have their cell phone number shared The reason why they are able to do that is because they can say I only want to share this with my friends where if I had to share it with 60 000 000 people than you wouldn t want to do that So actually giving people granular control over who they share information with actually allowed communication and that connection to take place That s a theme that s very broadly applicable across the whole product The more control the more granular control that we can give 00 26 00 people the more information that people are going to be able to share and the more we re going to be able to achieve our goals Almost across the board all the mistakes that we ve made are because we didn t give people enough control  Sarah Lacy Or you didn t communicate it Because there are times you had the control built in but people didn t recognize it   That s true  Sarah Lacy I want to talk about applications a little bit because you ve talked about all these big substantial things that Facebook is doing and obviously the moment when you guys opened up the platform was what really transformed the company But a lot of people criticize the application ecosystem because they say it s very frivolous there aren t things that are really that engaging you can t really build a business off of these What tweaks are you guys doing to that to make more Is it just a matter of you know time and the system evolving Are we going to see real substantive   There are pretty big changes underway with the system now and just in terms of a being At Facebook we believe that people are basically fundamentally good and that people aren t trying to game the system inherently and that basically the applications that you get are a product of the incentive structure that you ve setup  Sarah Lacy Yeah   So right now what we ve done is we ve basically said that we have some distribution channels and you can send a request to people you can send notifications you can get them to add your profile get a box and their profile and we allow you to do everything that you want up to a point If you pass a point where people say that you re too spammy then basically you get filtered And it s just a single threshold That behavior incentises people to do is get as close to that line as possible and basically be very spammy as you can without getting over the line But I mean these systems are all about trust  Sarah Lacy Right   So if we can make it so that which is the current trend and what we re moving towards and what we ve already rolled out a bunch of this with Popcorn 00 28 00 What we re trying to do is make so that if you re sending requests to people and they accept the request the more that people accept your request the more requests you re able to send and the more notifications The more people click on your notifications and find them valuable the more people find your feed stories valuable the ones that you re publishing then the more of those are going to be published So we are actually going to try to mine the system so that the application which are producing the most trustworthy useful information that people actually like are the ones that are able to publish the most and request the most in the system So we are fundamentally changing the incentive structure like that so it s going from being a set of rules to this very trust based system and reacting to what users are liking  Sarah Lacy Is that a fine line though in keeping the platform still very open and setting more and more rules around who gets to do what   Well in one way it s setting it s less rules The community that the Facebook users say okay this application is being too aggressive in how it s trying to promote itself therefore it needs to dial itself down So actually it s more basic there We re going to have to be setting most of these policies ourselves  Sarah Lacy Okay so real quick I want to ask you about the rumors in Financial Times that you guys are launching some IT and killer 00 29 12 negotiating with labels you re going to be the next music mogul What s really going on   I don t know No so so I mean I think what s going on there is we talked a lot of companies all the time about a lot of different things and I mean there are music applications on Facebook There are great music applications but it s traditionally been a vertical 00 29 35 that we haven t really gone after at all I mean we field photo applications that a lot of people use there are video applications that some people use Music is not something that we really touched on a lot One of the great things was as soon as we opened up Facebook Platform there were a lot of developers that fill that need so we don t even need to There are millions of people on Facebook who use applications like I like and other music applications 00 30 00 which are excellent applications which fill that void As a company we re out and we re talking to different companies in this space because we re building relationships and who knows how we ll work together in the future but at this point I can say that I don t think that s We have nothing to talk about right now  Sarah Lacy Is that something that is appealing to you though building a business like that Is it something that seems to make sense on Facebook   Well what we re really trying to do is just build We re trying to help people communicate and connect really efficiently and we think the way to do that is we re going to build some of our applications ourselves and then we re going to build the developer platform that allows developers to build the rest of them and some inside Facebook and an increasing amount outside Facebook That s basically the strategy that we re following at this point That s how we think we re going to have the best chance of meeting our goal  Sarah Lacy I just want to ask because I m totally confused on our signals How are we doing now  Audience  inaudible 00 30 51  Sarah Lacy Oh really oh wow I thought that was the 45 minute hand sign I was like times flying   What you ran out of questions  Sarah Lacy Oh no no dear God no you know me better than that I think one time I went and interviewed Mark for my book that s coming out that Mark is Mark s story is a big part It s going to be on Amazon I went over after this thing they call a hackathon at Facebook and the place was disgusting There was pizza on the four There was just a whole pile of weed bongos it was just like a tornado had come through and Mark was half asleep and I kept the poor guy there for about six hours asking him questions so compared to that you ll get off easy today So according to Forbes you are the youngest millionaire ever on their list   We re just not that focused on stuff like that  Sarah Lacy Obviously this is because 00 32 00 the 15 billion valuation the famous 15 billion valuation Okay I love Facebook I use it all the time but come on you don t actually think the company is worth 15 billion   I mean I just don t think we re thinking about that Right I mean  Sarah Lacy So take us through what you were thinking about in doing that deal   Well what we were thinking about is we want to get as little pollution 00 32 22 as possible and raise money on the most favorable terms And we were building this relationship with Microsoft and we had this ad relationship and several other things and we wanted to buy a piece of the company so we discussed this and this is what made sense But as a company what we are focused on is not necessarily all financial information so it s all the themes that we re talking about today in terms of helping people communicate more efficiently building this developer platform helping people map out who their friends are in order to help them communicate more effectively and in order to do that the way that we ve decided is going to be the most effective is for us to just go and build a business Because that allows us to attract a lot of the most talented people and build this ecosystem 00 33 07 and that s the way we think we re going to reach our goals  Sarah Lacy But in business terms is having a valuation like that a negative I mean it s certainly I would think it brings out a certain kind of person who wants to work at Facebook It brings out a certain element in the valley 00 33 22 that you ve kind of been crowned the next Google Maybe it s been prematurely and now you ve got to live up to this really high mark   Yeah I mean the high expectations are tough  Sarah Lacy I didn t mean Mark as a inaudible 00 33 32   The high expectations are tough I think in general it adds a lot of positive things 00 33 39 But you re right I mean the recruiting is one thing that s really important We want people to be joining the company because they believe in what we re trying to do and want to be a part of that Whether its building these types of monetization systems or building this developer platform or helping people map out who their friends are and helping them communicate with different people by building different types of applications We are even helping them communicate 00 34 00 the story of what we re trying to get done because I don t think we ve done that enough Having such a focus on money and the business has been tough for us because it can self select for people who just care too much about that And that s not where we are as a company so it s not like we ve gone out and said we re not going public anytime soon because we don t want to self select for people who want to join the company because they think that they re going to make money very quickly We think that if we do well then what we re doing in our mind will be a good business and that s great The value that the company ends up being worth will hopefully be relatively aligned and similar to the value that we re creating in the world Which is the platforms that we build 00 34 40 But revenue and value of the company are a trailing indicator of the value that you re building  Sarah Lacy Right   And that s what we need to focus on  Sarah Lacy I mean it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning whenever anyone talks about inaudible 00 34 52 It s ultimately the site itself and all these different roles it s playing in these communities that s the core If it wasn t doing that none of this other stuff would be happening Real quick back to this whole thing about not wanting to go public or get bought For such a long time up until that Microsoft deal it was such a topic of conversation and it was like 2 and I m not even at Facebook and I got irritated turning on CNC 00 35 20 every day and talking about this imminent IPO that s going to come at any moment Maybe the reason that you want to get a huge valuation like that is it kind of closes the door on that kind of speculation I mean obviously you guys aren t going to sell it because no one s going to pay 15 billion and you re probably not going to sell for less than your valuation Same thing with going public Is that a side benefit   Is which a side benefit Taking money at that valuation  Sarah Lacy Yeah yeah that high   I mean we re not we re not making that many decisions based on that It s not that we re opposed to going public or having an IPO At some point we may do that We ll probably do that at some point 00 36 00  Sarah Lacy But I guess that it throws down the gauntlet that we re building something so big and this is where we are now don t even talk to us about it   Well it s not even about necessarily the value Right I mean for example it s not that we don t want it it s just that we re not focused on it For a lot of companies that s the goal We do a certain set of things and then we can go public And for us that s not the goal and we just want to be clear with anyone who s potentially going to join the company or interact with us that that s really not what we re going to go for We had a similar thing in I guess it was 06 when Yahoo was trying to buy the company And they offered us 1 billion which was really a lot at the time  Sarah Lacy It s still a lot   It s a lot of money right  Sarah Lacy It s still a lot for people who aren t at Facebook   Part of it was we were thinking about okay perhaps the company would grow to be worth more than that The priority analysis that we were doing wasn t that okay we re here now are we worth 1 billion If we do this can we get to be worth more than 1 billion Is this the correct thing in our life to do It was really more like we got everyone together and we said okay we think that we might have a chance here to build a platform that fundamentally changes the way that people can connect and communicate How many times in your life do you get a chance to do that  Sarah Lacy Right   Zero or one and um we just decided we have to go for it A lot of people hereare making similar decisions I just think that s how I think about it  Sarah Lacy You know Jim Breyer who is on your own board he said at a time when you guys were going through the Yahoo thing that he realized that you were an entrepreneur who ran your business by sort of your gut feeling and your instinct and your heart 00 38 00 but you equally ran it through just sheer analytical like thinking things out and that when you were thinking about that deal both things told you it was a bad deal   Okay  Sarah Lacy I mean you re saying We all got together to talk it out What about you did not want to do the deal It s still very much your company I mean you have the control   Well a lot of people on the company didn t want to do the deal Sarah Lacy Really   Yes  Sarah Lacy That s not the word on the street The word on the street is that some guy people had stock options and they were looking at this and they were like you re crazy   Some people did want to do it but a lot of people didn t want to do it  Sarah Lacy You got rid of those people who didn t want to do it I have to ask    Inaudible 00 38 41 we did come out of it  Sarah Lacy While we re on the subject of management changes you have had somewhat of a revolving door in some positions One thing that I ve observed just from seeing you I think you re some people think you re at know it all kid who thinks he deserves to be CEO and you re not I think you know what you re good at and you know where you need help and you re very willing to bring people in and listen to them but if you don t like the way they go they don t stick around Is that fair   I don t know there are so many things that are just new that I don t have any experience with that I really rely on the people on our team to do I think a lot of it is just about about expectations and what people are trying to get out of it So for example with the Yahoo thing I think there were a lot of people but there were some people at the company who joined when it was way smaller for whom if they could sell the company for 1 billion that would have that would have been basically achieved a lot of their goals from joining the company  Sarah Lacy Well it sounds stretch goal 00 39 43 goal with 750 million   See how do you know all of this stuff that I don t even know about  Sarah Lacy I wrote a book about you You should read it   Well it s not out yet  Sarah Lacy Right So yes for other people that would be a huge success   But the people who are really focused on building something for the long term on this type of platform most of the people who started off with the company are still around For the growth that we have gone through I think that the amount of change that we ve had isn t a lot of change  Sarah Lacy I think that it s good that you fire people when they don t match 00 40 18 I think more people should do that I mean that s one of the biggest problems with a lot of startups is that people will feel they re friends with people and I think it s actually a strength   Okay  Sarah Lacy Anyone here need anyone fired There s someone there Let s talk about Cheryl since we re talking about friends   Sure  Sarah Lacy She s been called the token grown up and one thing I think is an important distinction is typically when grown ups get into start ups it s because their investors say you need a grown up She was very much someone you wanted to hire I mean that s not the situation there right   Yeah I mean I think we discussed how we re going to involve the company with the board and with the management so it is probably more of a group decision that it s been characterized But Cheryl s amazing We ve been looking for somebody who can help us scale our operation and help scale the company globally and right now we ve just passed this mark where we have 500 employees now That s crazy right It s growing really quickly so having someone who can help us scale is just going to be an incredibly important thing for the coming years So so I just feel really lucky to have her  Sarah Lacy How do you think she s going to navigate I m sorry I m a woman so I have to ask being a one in that environment Because it s a very male dominant environment and there aren t a lot of women in high leadership roles in Silicon Valley   Well I think she has a good track record there again I mean she has great relationships with all the people who are a big part of the process of having her join the company is just having her meet all these people I don t think it will be an issue 00 42 00  Sarah Lacy Okay so you mentioned the other day that you also now put Matt Cohler whose been with the company a long time in charge of product Is this the first time you haven t been in charge of product   Well we re building a product management organization now and I mean that s a really important thing for a company scale as well I think as the company s scale needs to fill out with different groups and different teams we just need to help people who are in different roles with the company grow and do a better job and learn how to do their roles better Matt Cohler has been a longtime executive at the company He s been here I think maybe more than three years at this point or going on four years and he s actually helped us build a lot of different parts of the company Early himself in marketing in H R recruiting now he s helping us build our product management team It s a pretty interesting step for us  Sarah Lacy Uh huh   because a lot of what we re trying to do is just help scale the company in a really effective way because the goals we have are so broad We re trying to build this platform that can support I think right now we have over 200 000 developers that s meaningful We re trying to build a great service for people to build the applications on top to help them communicate better So having a scale in the organization having a a guy like Matt Cohler be able to scale and grow the product management group and having a woman like Cheryl to run the business operations and scale down and help us scale globally to help us to scale down are just really important things for us to do next year  Sarah Lacy is it hard for you to step back from product management and let Because you re effectively being more the CEO now than you ve been before right   Well CEO is probably a more fulltime thing than I admitted before  Sarah Lacy Is it hard for you Because you d really rather be working on the product right   Yeah but I think just because we have a product management organization doesn t mean that I won t be involved and other people who aren t involved in that organization involvement in stuff We have a very collaborative culture where all the engineers who are working on these types of things like our marketing arm et cetera I think what Cohler is going to do is that he s just going to bring some more scale to the organization and help organize it a little bit better But yeah um I think it s definitely an interesting time frame  Sarah Lacy They always talk about whether or not you should stay CEO What about whether why do you want to be CEO So many people who are founders and sort of visionary people with your technical background hate the job of CEO Like Marc Andreessen would never be CEO in his life There s a you know Kevin Rose not CEO there I don t think anyone even reports to him Do you do it because you feel you want that level of control over what you re trying to build or is there something about being CEO that you actually like   Well I think what the CEO does is kind of sets the tone for the organization and sets the goal of what you re trying to build Right so what s important to me is building the system that we ve talked about better really just helping people communicate Being in that role is a good way to make sure that the organization focuses on that in its product development in its communications narrative that we re telling how we have our privacy policy set we talked about that and shape that dialogue in terms of the helper 00 45 18 platform that we build in terms of the advertiser systems that we build and how we scale our operations technical and business and I feel that that s that s just a really important thing as the organization grows it s increasingly important to help people keep their eye on what s actually important and what s important is that goal So I think as a CEO that s a lot of what I m doing  Sarah Lacy One thing occurred 00 45 43 to me when I was at Business Week covering you guys and otherwise inaudible 00 45 48 it s hard because once I could write about 1 0 using Facebook as the example and I mean ever since you guys did the Excel deal and had close to 100 million 00 46 00 you ve been out from everything else that s going on I think you guys are very distinct from the rest of web 2 0 world and you know one way is that you consider yourself a technology company and not a media company and draw a distinction on My Space another is you don t leverage yourself as this one big community Will you talk a little bit more about some of those distinctions   Well technology company is very important thing for the culture of the company There are a lot of parts of the company that part technical but what we ve tried to do is hire a leadership team that is largely technical for example the person who s running marketing for us Hoppitia 00 46 39 he has a technical background inaudible 00 46 41 our CFO has a technical background that he was an engineer in school And I think that having a technical background and an empathy toward that is what allows us to have pervasive in our culture empathy for developers It allows us to build a platform because we really believe that the way to reach our goals isn t by building all these sets of applications by ourselves that are perfectly useful for sharing information but to help a lot of other people build companies and build ways that people can help share information and help to communicate So I think being technical is just a very fundamental part of our company Um in terms of community I think that a lot of people say that we re community and that a lot of sites on the network whether it s a company or a high school or a city or whatever it is that are different communities But we think that that word is a very personal thing like for each individual it s a little different about how they fit into that community necessarily all the that helps and is a proxy for privacy settings and things like that in a lot of cases What the site is really doing is it s really a very personal utility that s helping people maintain their relationships more than anything  Sarah Lacy Can I ask you something about the books What we were talking about last night or will that embarrassed you   Oh go for it  Sarah Lacy Okay it s not that hard inaudible 00 48 05 so one thing a lot of people don t know about Mark was you still do this right So one of the first times that I interviewed Mark is that he has this pretty has these bound books that he painstakingly writes about everything he s thinking up and all his ideas for the site and where it s going And if you actually go back and look over for four years three four   Okay  Sarah Lacy You can actually see how this played out and when I was thinking about this you re a computer guy and you do all this in longhand on paper that it so many startups frequently just bob and weave through things but this sensible sort of vision like you had all along like you knew it was something that you saw early on very early on people were on the site and people thought it would be a good way right   Sure yeah I mean yeah  Sarah Lacy Lovely inaudible 00 48 49 moment The point   You have to ask questions laughter  Sarah Lacy Anyone who s watched my show inaudible 00 49 10 see me throw a full glass of water onMichael Aaren so you I m getting to the question so the fact that we see the site it s evolving over the last couple of years how much of that has been your original vision that you scrawled down in books and how much of it has been seeing how much people really use this site in reacting to it   Well I mean a lot of it are really broad ideas 00 50 00 To make a decision at work we were going to develop this platform and the majority of the applications that the people are going to use we developed ourselves or the ones that third parties and other people are b uilding but it s a really high level concept It s a pretty commonly held belief that the company for a long time before we had enough people using Facebook to make it worth having a platform for so I think Newsfeed It seems like is a pretty good idea in theory but a lot of the stuff that gets actually built there are a lot of details People look at things like Newsfeed and they say oh maybe that s good or maybe that wasn t good Popcorn maybe that s good or maybe that wasn t it but a lot of times and this might be a more pervasive cultural thing people chalk most things up to the original idea but the vast majority of work that went into that wasn t done by me writing in a book it was done by people like Facebook any other people who were actually building these things We were working on weeks and actually months so I think all of my I was just trying to help communicate and help people focus I really wouldn t want to downplay that it s really all these other people who are doing this work  Sarah Lacy Are there any high level directions that you had written in these books that when the company got to it you said we re not doing that inaudible 00 50 55 played out   I don t know The story you left out is that I destroyed the book  Sarah Lacy Actually I was going to let you tell that all right he burns them   I do not You made that up  Sarah Lacy Who was sitting with us last night 00 51 10 are you in here Did he not say last night that he burns them  Audience Talk about something interesting  Sarah Lacy Try doing what I m doing for a living It s not as easy as it looks Okay what do you want me to talk about sir  Audience Q A Audience Let us ask questions  Audience Q A Sarah Lacy How much time do we have left  Audience They re better than yours  Sarah Lacy Let s honor the dig style of new management and take over and let the mob rule You don t get to ask one  Female Speaker I see two major issues with this site One it s really hard you have a lot of floats for information but there s no real managing or holding onto it The other is that I can t really handle or control who sees what I know you said that s coming Do you see those as major issues and what are you going to do about them   Yeah I mean that s some of the most important stuff that we can do I mean in terms of building this framework for how other people can build applications and use the accomplishments that we ve built it s really important that people get as granular taken control as possible if you say yes I want to share this photo album with these people and not these people I think a lot of some of the reason why we don t have that stuff yet is that it s it s relatively complicated to control and we re trying to balance out giving people complete control and giving people a good sense of default settings so they don t have to do a lot of work in order to set things the way that they want But I think that that s an incredibly important thing for us to do If we don t succeed in doing that than privacy and trust are core pillars of what s going on here and we believe that actually letting people control information is what enables people to share a lot of information so we re not if we don t succeed at that in the next year then that s going to be an issue for us I agree But I think we will  Female Speaker We re not controlling information and how it s set to us because it s such an overload right now   So gaming things like need 00 54 00 a filter In Female Speaker When I m messaging you can t search within your messages for something that somebody said at some point You can t hold onto it posted item and tag it for later use It s really really hard to manage all of that content just right at your hand   Yeah I agree There are a lot of things like both of the things you just mentioned are things that I think are being worked on or will be worked on soon I don t know when exactly it will be out but I mean clearly they are very important things for us to do I think something that s really important to remember is that Facebook is still relatively constrained as a company and we re trying to do a lot of different things and this is a really important thing for us to build but I think like things take time as well I think we re working on it but we realize that it s an issue and that that if we re going to succeed at our goals we ve got to get there so thank you for bringing that up That s a good point  Sarah Lacy I m going to let this guy asked a question  Male Speaker Do you think there are so many applications that there will be a time that you ll have inaudible 00 55 04 What do you think about that   I think that the ideal format will be one that people can use applications that they want to and not use the applications that they don t want to Giving people that level of control over information that they want to get I mean first if they re sharing with different applications is going to be a really important thing We also want to remove a lot of friction that exists in the platform today So one of the issues that we see today is any time very frequently if you click on something that comes from an application you get taken to the dialogue to add an application We don t think that that s a great 00 06 40 so we re working on that So a lot of removing this friction is really important to us in cultivating this platform survey you guys can build really important applications but I uh I agree  Male Speaker Hi Mark 00 56 00 other than really rough interviews what do you think is the single biggest obstacle that Facebook faces laughter  Sarah Lacy What s that It s been a rough interview   No I think he s making fun of me  Sarah Lacy No he s making fun of me  Audience Yeah yeah  Sarah Lacy Hey someone send me a message later of why I suck so badly laughter  Sarah Lacy Go ahead   What was the question  Male Speaker The question was what is the biggest obstacle that Facebook faces in the coming future   I think a lot of it is around building these systems in getting people control while also building an easy product that gives people basic control over more than two '}\n",

that the new platform is going to work for Microsoft Mesh   There are things we ve talked about with them but there s nothing specific that we re announcing today right now  Speaker 3 So this is this is a relatively specific  Speaker 1 I think we re having problems with the wireless This is called a inaudible 00 01 37  Speaker 3 Thanks So this is a specific question relating to uh policy push applications going forward Um so I ve been hearing that some applications like Slides with Friends have been punished for things that other top applications have done as well and specifically top friends allowed users to access other people s accounts they weren t friends with who they 00 02 00 weren t connected to in an official way That s what they were punished for I believe Then at the same time any number of the top applications have that same problem but they weren t punished I think I like this more and I m not sure about the process How are you I mean how are you going to analyze what the past abuses were and how are you factoring that in exactly into grid great as mutual  Speaker 1 I ll take I ll let you take that The way that you might get you wanna The way the enforcement process works is not just based on an isolated incident It s based on a track record of responsiveness and user reviews and a whole variety of considerations so that when there s a particular issue what s evaluated that s not the issue itself but how they responded in the past what they say in response to the issue and that whole context So it s not appropriate to just look at one particular change or issue and compete from that The data you might want to add to this in terms of a great apps program that can focus on how customs how developers seek to advance the principles that are articulated and it s not particularly compliance with any particular rule  Speaker 4 That s like how are you going to like watch by the summer and  Speaker 1 So we re not again I ll start then Ben can add We don t have a point system We re committed to building relationships with developers We re trying to move away from a strict system a civil law system as it were of strict compliance with rules That s what I call more common law process with principles and that s the evolution of inaudible 00 03 48  Speaker 5 I think that that s pretty accurate so I have a high level with respect to enforcement readings We could be a lot more transparent with what our guided principles are as best practices 00 04 00 and they help developers understand And when developers are complying with best practices and principles we ll work with them to correct the violations  Josh Hi this is inaudible 00 4 15 in Germany other copycats in other countries inaudible 00 04 28   Well I can address that first one very specifically I think there are different ways that we think about working with all different companies around the world specifically ones in our space But if someone is blatantly ripping us off to the point that they have JavaScript pilots called FakeBook then that s something that we feel like we should keep consistent with We probably deal with the rest of the community That s one I want to make sure doesn t happen Can you be more specific about the question that you had around Open Social on Facebook  Josh Well um lots of my friends have had spam I was kind of how we say where are Google had a big market share we tried to make it open That s the first there s um we had not opened that s inaudible 00 05 38 on Facebook again inaudible 00 05 42 function in public space   Sure I mean we don t think about our product in terms of what other people are doing In think in some ways they may have similar goals in some ways I think what I spoke about in the keynote 00 06 00 in terms of we view that social applications are to start to decentralize a bit more and that instead of just having a few big social networks that seen launch five or six years are basically just like these large communities that have a few applications that they ve all just built themselves outside What we re going to start to see is they re going to start to split up into more different types of social applications first that happened by passing other platforms enabling other people to build different applications to complement their own inside of their own sites That next step is going to be to have that decentralized outside of their sites across the whole web So a company that s building an application inside of Facebook today may choose to build it outside of their own website tomorrow using Facebook connect and we re equally happy with that It s given people the same ability to share different types of information work with their friends in exactly the same way and it s just that s good from our perspective so and we think the natural state of the world is to be decentralized out a bit more We are just looking forward to that happening and trying to push that forward in any way we can  Speaker 1 Next question  Jesse Hey Jesse stay stayingalive com Um I uh was wondering what uh how is uh the plan to integrate the iPhone with uh FaceConnect and when will you be able to start playing with that and using it as a developer  Speaker 5 So the integration is basically the whole thing work and we re going to make it available at the end of the fall So essentially I figure we ll all have access to that  Speaker 1  inaudible 00 07 41 I ll come around there  Robert I m Robert Skill Um are there going to be any improvements to the messaging capabilities in Facebook coming in terms of   So there are and that s a different development track right now there s a platform and one of the things we ve added recently is basically 00 08 00 the ability to search through messages That s obviously a very simple thing but there s a number of things like that that we ve been adding that I think over time will  Speaker 1 Okay there s a question in the back I can t see  Speaker 6 Susan inaudible 00 8 16 for internetnews com This vision of Facebook sort of in the inaudible 00 08 22 decentralized application ecosphere runs at birth on the planet on the web of all places So in that kind of a world how does Facebook make a living how does it make money Is it applications to run on its platform like inaudible 00 08 42 com or what   There are lots of different ways that this work but for the next few years our primary focus and what we re experimenting with the number is really just to focus on the value that we ve provided in terms of helping people share information and exploding the userbase We ve been sharing it with a lot of different countries and that s one of the things we re most crowded over the last year The different internationalization and translation tools that we ve built In any given month there will be some new countries where Facebook is really just starting to take off That s just it s a different way of looking at the world and not a centralized web but that s an equally important way we look at the world in terms of helping people all over of all different ages in all different countries everyone to share information and hopefully the next few years that s probably a more primary focus for us and figuring out how we monetize and what exactly the optimal solution in that is going to be another thing that we work on but that s kind of the second part  Colin Hi Colin Chatterly here Yes I want to follow up on your vision Where does Face what does Facebook evolve into when you have the technique You become a courthouse you become a starting point for people spread out over the Internet what in your vision 00 10 00 what makes Facebook itself evolving into as far as   When we think we re building something of the ecosystem so the core platform that a lot of the other applications run on top of that can be other platforms as well as part of that but we can do ours as an important piece of that The feed structure the thing that can actually host and store a lot of the different information we think is really valuable goal for people and we succeed and the new feed the wall that we built in people s profiles and these are some of the applications that I think we re going to continue to be used inside Facebook A little different communication application We have photos application its very widely used and a number of others I just think that as time goes on what we re going to see is that even large number and rapid more rapid birth in terms of the number of applications that s being observed outside of Facebook So there will be more different ways that people can share That s going to be good It s gonna work It s going to add value Core to core platform that we re building it s going to add value for that feed system that we re building and that I think is going to be a long term kind of important thing for us but the way that we think about it the world is moving in this direction I mean I don t we re not pushing the world in this direction because we have a choice We think it s going to decentralize and that s good It s going to be good because people are going to have a lot of different ways to share information The world will just be more open and connected and anything we can do to accelerate that we want to do That s fine how we say that  Kelly Hi Kelly Tanaka with Forbes Um I want to ask you more about OpenSocial besides for people here So are you guys going to be joining or not   Well I mean we don t have anything to announce there today I mean I m glad you came It s cool But we are a big fan of a lot of other companies that are doing things that you might call competitors 00 12 00 of us but I mean we just view them as all part of this movement We re all kind of pushing the web forward in the same direction so I think what they re doing is cool in a lot of ways  Kelly Do you continue to talk to them   Well we ll talk about it when we have something to do  Kelly Can I just ask one other thing about the clones Can you elaborate on what kind of actions you might be taking among clones to get them abroad   Sorry I can t hear you  Kelly Clones Clone sites  Speaker 1 The attack of the clones question  Kelly I m sorry  Speaker 1 Can I just say something once   Sure  Speaker 1 You said in response when you filed the action uh in Germany we were we believe in innovation not imitation So to the extent that there are other companies out there that are innovating that helps us get better When we say that companies out there are imitating that s not helping users or helping advance the movement or you know that achieves the kinds of goals we re talking about And we don t think that s particularly fair How how we re going to respond to any particular date well that depends on the circumstances we re we re not supporting imitation we re supporting innovation  Voss Um Voss from Silicon Valley Insider I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the Open Web Foundation what is your what is your involvement is it is it other partners  Speaker 5 So when we announced our support for the new web foundation so we ll be continuing dialogs with the group with them also contributions and when we have more to announce with them we ll definitely give you that report  Speaker 7 Mr Facebook uh sorry Do you think Facebook will be thrown into a business inaudible 00 10 43   You certainly think you think that there s a utility for everyone here and when we talk about the social wrap we talk about people s friends family coworkers there s all different types of connections and one of the things that s kind of interesting 00 14 00 is that internally at Facebook we wrote a lot of tools for internally managing the company on top of the social graph all right so you think that over the long term that there can be a lot of good applications that are that could be built in this case in this way but going back to the question about how the web is going to decentralize there are big questions that we have Who s going to build those applications We belive in focus and it s not clear that we have to build those applications It might be better off if some other company that s more focused on enterprise software builds that and that could be a really big opportunity in the ecosystem So I think we d be really happy if somebody else did that But I definitely think that our view is that applications over time that social graph will help people share their business contacts themselves  Junction Junction Alreida TV You guys have any plans to take the cuts of any virtual goods or virtual track at this point They didn t track that until the virtual booth comments on the site do you   I mean we ve thought about a number of different things but I mean I think that that s that that s not something that we ve really figured out yet Just all the questions about modernization I think that s the today what we want to talk about we re just talking about some of the new product evolutions we re doing with platform and I don t want any of your open ended answers that I give today Need the modernization thing to say we are or are not exploring certain things but I think it s pretty clear that if you haven t figured out the exactly optimal way for us to do this yet and we re exploring a number of things But that s not really what we have anything to talk about today  Junction On the Kinect there s not enough choice of things imported into your feed Are we going to see a dramatic increase Like the video I m filming right now it can t be imported I can t have more than one blog into it Are we going to see more choices 00 16 00 on the Kinect   So you re talking about is actually it s it s a related but somewhat different functionality It s from inside Facebook to allow you to import from different places It definitely will as time goes on I mean that s somewhat of a different project although the two are very closely related All these things are helping people share information for feeds  Speaker 8 There s gonna be out to twitter or out to my blog inside facebook so it s not just inbounds in all sorts of countdown as well   I m sorry  Speaker 8 Are you going to see more two way behavior between centralized so I can be inside Facebook all the time post that down to twitter or to other places   If you re going to use the Twitter application within Facebook  Speaker 8 I know but I m talking about from inside Facebook Am I going to see these more decentralized apps have more of a two way nature rather than a one way nature to it   Sorry I m not I feel like I understand the nature of what you re talking about but I m not sure if I understand your specific question There s an app inside so I can basically conclude it can communicate with whatever it wants Are you asking if our applications will or what specifically  Speaker 8 Yeah Well the feed itself You know you re trying to really I can bring Twitter and other things into my feed and interact with the service but I can t put messages back out from that feed I have to add an application to do that   Yeah we thought about different RSFs implementations and things like that Um my guess is we ll get around to it eventually It s not immediately obvious what we should do because different people will get different feeds because of privacy and because there are constantly like updates to different and people can change their privacy after the fact we want to trap things like that It s not something that we don t think will happen I think in the list of things that will happen that it will I check that because the answer s not immediately clear 00 18 00 what should happen It just hasn t been at the top of our list of things to do  Speaker 9 Let s go to a question about the you ve changed the uh the profiles to uh when will we be seeing the business profiles shape changing to a new design Right now it s kind of an eyesore well not necessarily an eyesore or it s definitely has the old profile look and feel in contrast to the current user profiles Wondering where are you planning to go with that and how are you going to adapt to the business profiles on Facebook   Sir what do you mean about the business profile  Speaker 8 The pages I m sorry Facebook pages   Oh oh Yeah I mean as part of this effort and we should try to make pretty iterative changes This was a pretty difficult thing to iter '}\n"

Inhales Secondly pause I m going to ride this puppy till the end Just so you know Setting the phone down I m not giving up now or forever until you are the biggest Sandberg laughs thing in the world

Sandberg  1 01 Yeah We re looking forward to it Smiling  Kara Swisher  1 02 Steve Steve K uh no no not at all then At one 1 point he was You don t care if we go up or down And I m like No Shaking her head No shaking her head really no Both stories are good Zuckerberg airy chuckling for me So um shot pause so let s get into it Smiling That s great Let s get into the situation here at Facebook Smiling and chuckling First of all I have to say I I m I quick pause I promised that I would make this apology Swallows When I started writing about Facebook when we started All Things D I wanted to focus in on companies that I thought were really interesting and one 1 of the things that s great about the blogosphere is that you can truly obsess emphasis on people like crazy At any time at night I can just yeah click away Yeah you know about that We ve noticed Yeah I know Um so a and you can find people and it s really fun that way And and obsession is I c it s working really well for me So Audience and Sandberg laugh a little what s interesting about it is that sometimes I go a little too far it s the middle of the night eh you do not sleep when you blog and you especially when you have small children um and pause I I called you something that I shouldn t have called you It was very funny as far as I was concerned I called you Toddler CEO um it got on 60 Minutes uh Lacy Stahl was like impersonation So you called him Toddler emphasis CEO What does that mean And I was like Oh Rolls her eyes And then I realized it was actually somewhat rude and I should not have called you that Um I should not call you teenage CEO I should not call you Zuckerberg laughs You are twenty three 23 Zuckerberg smiling and laughing twenty four 24    2 10 I just turned twenty four 24 Big full open smile  Kara Swisher  2 13 Twenty four 24 year old CEO That s what I m going to call you Zuckerberg with a big smile and laughing Uh so I should call you slight chuckle Toddler CEO but it it was funny Inhales Um Zuckerberg smiling Zuckerberg Audience and Swisher laugh but but in the middle of the night I should resist that urge Yeah I have a lot of stuff I want to say in the middle of the night that I that I do edit myself Use the phone Exactly I should you use the phone You should use the phone Let s get into uh Facebook Now i i why one 1 of the reasons I do write about you so much is I find it a really intriguing and amazing pause inhales company in a very short time pause creating and addressing a real problem that people have about swallows pause their online presence and I do believe pause that the reason I do focus on it is cause the promise is huge emphasis as far as I am concerned You re and you re one 1 of the first companies along with MySpace and all the other social networking sites but especially Facebook inhales it s really captures people s attention of usefulness utility inhales online presence and so that s why I I m interested in it Inhales Um let s get right into I m going to get I m going to talk to you Sheryl about why you left Google and what you re pause do ing there Um but u u Mark talk a little bit about you ve been written about a lot you ve gotten a lot of attention What is pause Facebook right now How do you see it at this moment You ve talked about as a utility you ve talked about it as lots of different things Mhm Define Facebook pause J Jerry was asked to define Yahoo Pause Whether he did so well yeah or not or not How do you Pause    3 21 Inhales So I mean Facebook is about helping people share information and share themselves okay Right And for the last four 4 years pause what we ve been doing is just building projects that in different ways quick pause inhales help people share different parts of their personality help them communicate mhm um share parts of their identity with each other and just open up And and in a way that they re comfortable with right and there are a lot of important pieces to that that make that possible so giving people complete control over their privacy Right And and the information that they put out there mhm Inhales So and that s really critical in order to help people share that information mhm Inhales But a lot of it is just building short pause different products that are different views on how people live and and different parts of people s lives So I mean pause early on we built this Photos application It was really widely used right and um and pause a a lot of people used that to just uh kind of pause get a different view on pause on their friends and what other people around them  Kara Swisher  4 08 Starts talking over Zuckerberg Which people have been doing on the web They have been doing a different way I mean it s not yeah pause nodding it s not the newest way But what is what differentiates it Wha what how do you look at yourself in this special application vs every single thing on Facebook is replicated somewhere else Zuckerberg nods How do you how do you imagine that what you re doing is very different If at all    4 25 Inhales Well a lot of it is how howit s tied together Pause Right so pause people share information short pause and share part of themselves so that they can be shared with with the specific people that they want to see it So we we have really good privacy settings so that people aren t sharing with the people that they don t want to mhm but because Facebook is this network and everyone s friends are there Inhales Um people can effectively share the the information photos blogs videos inhales different parts of their identity different information status updates whatever they want with people and those people will get it immediately mhm Right so that that distribution is really important  Kara Swisher  4 56 Starts talking when Zuckerberg is finishing Who are you looking to as inspiration I mean uh uh what was your everybody has no not necessarily mentor I m not talking about that what were you looking at that you saw that you thought This is great but I m going to change it this slight emphasis way Cause it s not again I don t call it new thing I don t find everyone s like Oh Facebook All of a sudden it s the best thing since sliced bread but pause it s been around pause the block people have done this What is what did you look for when you first started    5 19 Well this trend of people sharing information short pause about themselves and just sharing information together online has been something that has been around forever Right I mean we ve been building Facebook for for four 4 years now but I mean even before that when I was in college a little while and high school before that right I was still building applications that pause that um pause kind of played along with this trend  Kara Swisher  5 39 Talking over the end of Zuckerberg s response What what original companies was it AOL What what did you look at What were you what informed you just quick pause said with disbelief several years ago what was what were you using that was inspirational to you    5 48 Um pause looking up when anything on the web I mean I I think AOL was was starting to smile definitely something that was interesting to me when I was in high school and Okay nods Um I remember pause some of my pause my early um pause developing days were were just kind of hacking different things on the AOL platform I I don t even know if they called it a platform okay But just different people would make stuff in chatrooms and and things like that all the time and it was interesting because a lot of my friends in high school pause mhm also learned how to program and grew up pause by building thing on top of AOL and that s kind of interesting because a lot of people now are doing that on top of Facebook Platform  Kara Swisher  6 21 Right exactly Which you re allowing Zuckerberg nods Stuff like that So so when you decided to come here you i i explain what it was like to decided and then I ll Sheryl something Garbled speech Um what it was like to come to Silicon Valley You have instant attention right away Emphasis pause That s a little bit daunting pause for anybody and daunting for someone who s young Pause What was explain that phenomenon It s happened before a million times in Silicon Valley But here you are    6 43 Well actually we started off na not that quickly I mean I hesitation just I mean I built Facebook with a couple of my roommates Pause Right at Harvard mhm And early on we we actually tapered the growth and kept it in by launching one 1 college at a time Pause mhm And once we go to about thirty 30 colleges pause and it was taking off at all of them We decided Okay this is something that might be worth spending some time in And we decided to invest one 1 emphasis summer pause in it and we wanted to get away from Harvard just cause a bunch of us had been there for and so many people do yeah all slight emphasis of Freshman year Yeah smiles well you know And um At least it would be a good plan getting away from Harvard Getting away from Harvard Smiling pause Harvard was fun Okay pause Only there for two 2 years Smiling  Kara Swisher  7 20 Were you lonely and stayed in your room and didn t go to classes Sandberg chuckles and gamed like Bill Gates Pause    7 24 I I have a funny story about that Alright go ahead But um but anyhow so so no I want to hear the funny story Mark Small airy laugh of disbelief Well this is a this is a story too Smiling So So alright okay so we pause answered smiles your original question Alright So we um when we moved out to California just for the summer and originally I mean we weren t think about starting a company or anything like that I remember explicitly thinking short pause that there are so many great companies our here and you drive down 101 right mhm and you see Yahoo and all these great companies mhm And um swallows pause I was thinking you know it would just be great to spend some time out here for the summer and get to know some of these companies inhales pause and maybe one 1 day I ll I ll build a company as a part of something but but this isn t that company okay Um scoffing laugh okay not this so yeah then um then at the end of uh pause a at the end of that summer a bunch of us just ended up just staying out in California and Harvard has this policy where you can take off as much time as you want and then go back whenever so short pause mhm we took off a term and then we took off another term and pause now we re here Smiles  Kara Swisher  8 17 Okay What s your funny story Long pause Zuckerberg smiles Audience laughs Is that it    8 21 No that wasn t the funny story  Kara Swisher  8 22 Okay so What about Harvard and being lonely Were you a lonely person there or what  Swisher and Audience laughing Zuckerberg smiling and laughing    8 29 I m a shy person  Kara Swisher  8 30 You you re somewhat shy You re not quite as shy as Bill Gates Did you stay did you hesitation like the high college experience What was pause Zuckerberg starts talking the    8 36 Yeah College was good Actually it was it was really funny listening to Bill yesterday talking about he never went to class Uh uh huh it it reminded me of this story when it was actually wo one 1 of the w one 1 of the applications that pause that I think is pretty similar to how people use Facebook to to share information together which is inhales they they have this core curriculum at Harvard where you have to take certain types of classes mhm and they have this Lit and Arts requirement And I remember I was taking this class The Rome of Augustus pause mhm where you had to pause um pause i it was just all all about art in the time of Augustus and Rome mhm And um pause swallows I didn t go to class the whole term okay and then during reading period pause B Bill was talking about ho how he studied a lot and made up everything there and and learned it before the final Inhales And um long pause I was planning on doing that but instead pause that s short pause when we built Facebook okay so so I didn t really Audience laughs Zuckerberg smiles so I didn t really have anytime then so so a few days before this class s final exam was going to be taking pause uh looks up I think it was some number of images from from the class s artwork and being able to explain the historical significance of them So I just went to the went to the course website and downloaded all the images pause and made a little website where each one 1 of the images had its own page and you could pause put um pause a and people could go and add comments to the page and mhm and explain what was going on And and then I sent a link out to the classlist saying Hey I built a study tool Smiling And um Audience Sandburg and Swisher laughing hard whistling within Stopped because of laughing 10 03 That is a funny story So with within a half an hour it just all all the information of all the Audience and Swisher laughing Zuckerberg smiling the pieces of artwork were there and um and pause I I think I well I passed the course I don t remember what I got but I remember the professor told me some time after that the course that the grades on the final right were better than he expected them to be  Kara Swisher  10 20 Wow That s great Good for you Zuckerberg laughing It s like Stone Soup So you    10 24 I I don t understand that reference  Kara Swisher  10 26 Alright I ll tell you that later Audience Zuckerberg and Swisher laughing  Sheryl Sandberg  10 29 I don t understand it either  Kara Swisher  10 31 You know I m telling my kids later I could make a joke but I m not going to but Um pause so you short pause you did the Harvard thing too but a little differently Uh huh Uh people Sheryl s been with Google for a long time but Google s all Sandberg smiling about Larry and Sergey sitting on an exercise ball pretty much Sandberg smiles and nods in terms of public image And you have been one 1 of the major executives there for a long time Let s talk a little bit about how you guys ga got to and then we ll talk about why emphasis you came to Facebook Sandberg nodding too Um you start Harvard you like the pedigree all over the place smiles I graduated You graduated from Harvard Yeah Nods You went to Harvard and then you went to Harvard again Or wha pause nodding back for business school back for business school Sandberg nodding And you were involved in government w what was the what was the nods I was in the you were in a whole different career path before you got Google Was was it seems very pause you know very Harvard business Harvard Harvard business school kind of thing what did what did you imagine your life was going to be before before pre Google kind of thing  Sheryl Sandberg  11 17 Pre Google I d work for the government During the Clinton year I worked in the Treasury Department with uh Larry Summers mhm That s his Chief of Staff mhm And then Any funny stories No sorry Lots of funny stories None of which I ll share Okay smiles That not being the topic for today Okay okay Uh some laughter in the Audience but after that pause needed a job they elect a new president therefore you have to get a new job and they kind of kick you out of office it s in the constitution and stuff right So needed a job uh came out to Silicon Valley and pause hesitation met people and really wanted to work in technology right And met Larry and Sergey And why technology I m curious Because if you re sitting at the Treasury or anywhere and you re looking for at a macro sense about what striving the economy and it was pretty obvious that it was technology mhm And so if you want to be a part of building companies or businesses or organizations technology seemed t for me at least to be the obvious place to be  Kara Swisher  11 59 So you had did you have other job offers somewhere else  Sheryl Sandberg  12 02 I had some others  Kara Swisher  12 03 That were much more traditional  Sheryl Sandberg  12 04 Nods That were much nodding more traditional I really wanted to come out to Silicon Valley okay And it was a weird time to come to Silicon Valley in that it was inhales pause the beginning of 2001 huge lay offs pause post bubble at least pause then  Kara Swisher  12 15 Right sure  Sheryl Sandberg  12 15 And you know I didn t have the obvious backgrounds but some people were nice to me and met me and pause wound up at Google and Pause You know loved Google Google  Kara Swisher  12 23 And pause talk a little bit about Google your Google experience You know again a lot of people don t a lot of the executives at Google There are several here that you wouldn t recognize mhm necessarily What did what did w w Pause How did you look at that experience being there Pause  Sheryl Sandberg  12 35 Inhales You know when I pause was at the Treasury the Treasury was a hundred and forty thousand 140 000 people it was a large emphasis organization that worked in very specific ways Inhales So for me I wanted to go somewhere small and help build something Nodding Having a sense that you ve you ve started the right way you could pause build it It might be more pause you know creative pause then mhm pause the Treasury right Um and got really lucky You know lucky Larry and Sergey hired me and believed in me and pause built out what was the online sales channel and a bunch of the operations for Google Nodding  Kara Swisher  13 01 And what do you think the key to that velocity was which Tom was just talking about here Wh what was the key into getting that kind of velocity going Like finding that one 1 business plan pause that s like hesitation owning the heroine business of all time Or what  Sheryl Sandberg  13 12 Well I think it was something similar to what I see in Mark and one 1 of the reasons I made this move Inhales Is an incredible focus pause on what you re trying to do while you re trying to do it not on the people who are using your products mhm Someone gave me a great T shirt at one 1 of these conferences that says you know Make peop make something that people want mhm You know really product focused on the user At Google you know every conversation was about the user and similarly at Facebook all the conversations come down to the users What are they doing How are they doing it Inhales Developer ecosystem advertiser ecosystem all centers back on pause how we are changing lives for the users  Kara Swisher  13 42 Okay Let me get back to you before pre Sheryl Google I mean pre Sheryl Facebook So here you come you get this funding celebrated uh you were a hot thing I mean you have been the hot thing this past year and we like our hot things since Silicon Valley Wi a wi talk about Zuckerberg smiles the impact that you wanted to stay the leader of this company correct Zuckerberg slightly nods You wanted to always stay the leader Let me get something straight Did you actually have a card that said Pause Zuckerberg smiles Did you I I don t know I It was a joke that someone made for me Someone made he had this card that said I m the CEO bitch Correct And it was you didn t mean to had it out Did you    14 11 Inhales No I definitely did not mean to give it to the journal  Kara Swisher  14 13 Okay I just wanted to clear that up I Zuckerberg smiling Zuckerberg Swisher and Audience laugh It s like the Pez Dispensers at E bay It s one 1 of those ridiculous legends Inhales Uh Zuckerberg smiling inhales  Kara Swisher  14 21 So um Pause Zuckerberg smiling you you want what what made you want to stay pause in charge of this company at at when a lot of founders do get moved aside They do get bring in uh hesitation you you brought in obviously Sheryl and different people but you wanted to stay the pause the supreme leader of this company The CEO What tell me why you thought what you think you bring to the why that s important    14 39 Yeah Sure I mean I think what we re doing here is pause we re helping people share information and share themselves And that s been this trend that s been happening for for a while but we ve also built a lot of products at Facebook pause that have kind of furthered that in a lot of ways Whether it s just the initial product inhales of helping people share different pause interests of theirs or um different classes that they are taking starting college um the privacy settings things like pause the Photos application the Wall um Newsfeed like pretty innovative products that help people share more information and get more information And recently the development Platform mhm that allows pause any developer in the world which we ll talk about in a little bit to be able to Yeah to be able to um to just build even more applications that make it so that people can share information in different ways on the service Pause inhales We re nowhere near the end of this trend  Kara Swisher  15 25 Obviously But I m asking Why you Why do you why do you wanna what s what s been what do you see that you re the I asked Jerry this He didn t quite answer it but why are you the leader Why did you feel like that you needed to be the    15 35 Well I think that the CEO basically does two 2 things Pause They short pause set the vision for the company pause and they recruit a team Long pause mhm And you know so far I think we have this vision and we re in the middle of executing on it We re pause only four 4 years in so I think that there is a lot left to go pause inhales and you know pause building a team is the other really important piece of that and and spending a lot of time focused on that And pause you know getting Sheryl to join was a huge thing for us  Kara Swisher  15 57 Right Alright let s talk about the before that I m not going to n n focus on Beacon we ve I ve written a lot it so But what was the what was a thing you learned in some of the pause more error prone things What what have you learned in this first ye essentially first pause couple years as a CEO What s the Pause Wha wha what have you learned about leadership and and being that doing that Like in taking away from Beacon and you don t have to about it in detail but what did it teach you what was the thing that you walked away from that with    16 22 About management and leadership specifically or just about just about what what you re doing what we re doing Inhales Well short pause I think the the thing that we kind of had to workout pause was there there are a lot of different ways to get people pause to to help people share information about themselves and to share themselves to the people around them And the formula that we ve found that has really worked is short pause you give people control longer pause and they ll share pause a a mu more information about themselves They ll they ll be comfortable They ll they ll be able to short pause c um control exactly who they re sharing information with and that s how people are able to open up and communicate better Mhm pause inhales So I mean pause I mean you didn t want to bring up Beacon but I will okay Um I mean I think go right ahead uh Beacon was was the big mistake for us in in a lot of ways but I mean one 1 of the things that we really learned from that was pause to just reinforce this point to us That they re lots of different ways to go about helping people share information pause and the ways that we re the ones that we re the ones that are successful for us are the oneks where we re giving people complete control So when we fail long pause then we end up in situations like that And when we succeed we end up creating a lot more transparency among us  Kara Swisher  17 19 Starts talking over Zuckerberg Was Beacon actually a a mistake pause conceptually The idea of it Because you re trying a new advertisment paradigms I mean I don t necessarily think it was pause a mistake conceptually It was more executionally in a lot of ways and then how it was    17 30 Talks over Swisher Well I mean it fits into pause a lot of thing that we are trying to do but pause I I think the UI was was not as good as it could have been It really the things that we needed to have that we do have to be clear Right mhm And people need to have control over the information mhm that they re sharing  Kara Swisher  17 42 I m curious why for example in Beacon you didn t make that the stuff that people were already sharing like Flickr or YouTube or make it first not pause an ad emphasis product Make it a product that was shrugs useful    17 52 Inhales Well it was interesting because I mean functionally within the organization pause um longer pause Beacon is part of the Platform team it s not even a part of the Ad team mhm And we launched it as right apart of the ad system right um but but I mean that s not even how we view it ourselves And right since the we we have launched ad additional products in in this Feed importing product where you can import from other services right like that Nodding Yeah  Kara Swisher  18 11 And not necessarily the in the ad no sense yeah In that things that I want not ads to mean to share elsewhere on the web Let s talk about wu a i i where you re going next and the Platform and um monetization which is my obsession I m not that I I do make fun of about widgets being useless and juvenile but and I do want to talk about that but um laughs I do want to get to that but let s first talk about wha what what decision making did you cu come from Google Here you are at the pause you know the powerful company of Google who is now which is now the big pause dog Pause How what kind of decision making went into that  Sheryl Sandberg  18 41 Smiling inhales You know I was inspired Pause Okay I think the uh web is changing and evolving if the kind of the first phase and you know it s kind of hard to put things it phases but pause if the first phase was about accessing information which was largely an anonymous process I look at we know you but a lot of people your website is anonymous They re not interacting with you directly They re reading right And then you know they can post We think increasing or I think increasingly pause this is becoming more social The web is enabling people to really form communities and to bring pause the ties that are so much a part of their life pause into what they are doing online and then back into their life And I saw this trend happening and pause was excited by it Um and then met Mark and was inspired by him because he mhm really does have a sense of vision and purpose about what this company is trying to do and how how it was going to get there  Kara Swisher  19 25 Talks over Sandberg Had you had you reached a boredom at Google What was the you were on maternity leave I know and you pause Sandberg nodding and you were looking around You were  Sheryl Sandberg  19 32 Smiling I had not quite started I was on maternity leave had my second child went back pause um pause and then long pause was kind of approached about pause some other things that weren t at Google and were at Facebook Inhales And I had been there about six and a half 6 years and looking for something new Inhales pause And then long pause nodding very interested in what this company was trying to do and what I saw as the evolution of practices on the web Inhales And also excited by the opportunity to go again to something that was small I mean the opportunity to go to Google I joined when it was about pause two hundred and sixty 260 people and help build something Pause To have those opportunities are hard to find mhm and this is one 1 of those opportunities Inhales And so to be able to go to a company that I really emphasis believe in the mission and vision of what it s trying to do pause and then help it scale pause you know make slightly fewer mistakes than I made last time is Might just be opportunity of a lifetime  Kara Swisher  20 16 Talks over Sandberg smiling What s your biggest what was your what was your biggest mistake  Sheryl Sandberg  20 17 Oh there are so many  Kara Swisher  20 18 Okay Sandberg laughs Um we can get into that in a second Let s talk about um the opening of the Platform Pause About what you re doing You re undergoing right now a a Platform change right now of of longer pause basically prettying up the service and cleaning it up and doing changing the way it looks for people everything We ll get to that in a second But you were the first to open up the Platform to these third parties which is I think most people feel is a smart move I mean I do I think it was really a inhales great idea and people are copying it now Yahoo talk about it in a very broad way today inhales but what um wi i talk about that experience opening up and the and the pitfalls and the things maybe you pause haven t liked so much and the things that you think have be stronger  Zuckerberg 20 55 Sure Long pause So longer pause I me mean the the original reason why we wanted to open up is that we saw there were all of these different social application that that we could build pause mhm to help people share information in different way but we realized that we were never going to be abl to be able to build all of them And we also realize that we weren t pause even going to be able to identify all of the interesting ones that that could be built  Kara Swisher  21 15 Starts at the very end of Zuckerberg talking So we re back to the study guide then Okay Go ahead    21 17 Yeah sure So pause so I mean pause building the the Development Platform to make it so that any outside developer could make build all the same types of applications that we could inside of Facebook would kind of just allow anyone across the world to help us explore the space of possible applications Mhm inhales Um I I think in the first year we ve it s been pretty good It grew a lot mhm Faster than we even thought it would I mean it s more than three hundred thousand 300 000 developers now and um pause and a lot of different applications And pause you know I mean there there are really interesting and good ones too in verticals that inhales pause that we hadn t really anticipated or that we specifically not gone after ourselves So for example music We purposely didn t build a music application cause we didn t want to get involve in that but within four 4 days of releasing Platform pause um this company iLike had built a music application that right had a million users One 1 of the more successful Right so so that s pretty interesting I mean a another category that I think is pretty interesting is pause we hadn t done anything with games games pause on the site And I mean that s a big way that people interact socially And there have been applications like Scrabulous that swallows pause I think um Walt mentioned earlier games pause and um it was just built by a couple of guys in India and  Kara Swisher  22 25 A little bit of issues around that With copyright Zuckerberg laughs but but um okay Ga There s a lot of gaming It ll get worked out They ll get worked out I m sure they will Zuckerberg smiling And find them But you ll shoplift and then work it out Sandberg and Audience laughs But good um gu But but the idea of quick pause of of of these these things are you talking about two 2 areas slight nodding that I actually think are great The gaming I just wrote about social gaming network Mark uh Mark Pincus s group at Zynga um pause very important I do like the music applications How do they have emphasis to become useful because again I I I I don t I am making a funny joke and a snarky joke but a lot of them seem juvenile hit based pause silly and in need emphasis of they re not Word they re not pause Excel they re not and nothing has to be as dull as that but they they have to have some sort of Sandberg does a short laugh um pause you know resonance in your life usefulness C What what has emphasis to happen there Or do you think it s just going to be all these entertainment Pause And people can argue Keith here from Slide argues with me all the time about this that I m no fun and that s entirely true But pause wha what has to pause happen in that area to become pause daily usage and you get the uptake from people using every every person using it everyday    23 28 Mhm Pause Well I mean I think that there there are two 2 things that I d say to that The first is that pause there probably are a bunch of applications that pause are useful in a more traditional sense I mean there this Causes application that allows people to it s very nice to raise money for you know different fill and non profit causes and raise awareness and I mean that s a serious application Right mhm It s doing serious good Inhales pause And then there s this other trend on the internet which is to just that utility and usefulness doesn t necessarily have to be this big thing anymore it can take place in in a lot of little interactions mhm Right so a a lot of what s happening on on Facebook and trends on the web are people post a little bit on content but they do it more frequently Right and we re seeing that with things like status updates they re just really short pieces of content Um even pause people uploading photos short pause that people more likely now emphasis short pause inhales through nose to upload things like a mobile photo One 1 mobile photo mhm Right then they they were before This this trend is toward much smaller more frequent updates Right right And that s how people are sharing themselves online right So I mean so a lot of these other things that pause that you you might look at and and traditionally say don t look like Microsoft Word or Excel right can still be really useful mhm I don t know do turns head to look at Sandberg you have pause any  Sheryl Sandberg  24 33 Yeah you know my roommate in college was an Elvis fan and that wasn t very popular And she had a button which she wore sometimes which said A hundred million Elvis fans can t be wrong right And joking aside you know can twenty 20 mil I I m a huge Elvis fan Perfect I ve been to Tupelo So don t But can twenty 20 million people who are spending time poking each other Max is here thank you for that application it s very popular Inhales But pause can that be wrong or is that not have value And pause we we understand that we want our developers to continue to work and integrate more into user s lives inhales but we also think there s real value being created in the things that seem whimsical and fun Inhales Swisher starts talking And  Kara Swisher  25 05 Okay I agree They have value Stupid pet trick have value too But I mean where is the the advertising para how do you begin is that how you become a serious advertising biz How do you translate yeah um and I know a lot of shows make a lot of money They re silly and stupid and pause you know half of the shows on television today are pause getting dumber Inhales Um w how do you how do you translate it into a new advertising paradigm Cause that s what you were talking about Mark You you made this grand statement about changes in advertising How do you see you explaining that to people and getting that to port over Short pause Besides peop lots of people using them They ve got to feel like it s a useful useful spend for a Budweiser practically yeah nodding gambled no of course those people  Sheryl Sandberg  25 45 Inhales I mean wo one 1 thing that s what s really worked online and obviously something we re all really familiar with is What is demand fulfillment mhm The majority of online spend where people are most satisfied marketers advertisers is demand fulfillment Someone knows what they are looking for they can get it We knew we wanted a princess phone once we heard about it this morning okay We did a search we found it it was a target Where d you search Uh I didn t do it We had someone do it Zuckerberg laughs But probably Google Alright Zuckerberg laughing I hope Google Smiles and laughs inhales I still remain loyal But pause you know we knew what we were doing It was demand fulfillment But a larger part of what is advertising spending all over the world is in demand generation traditional brand spending Right inhales And the question there is How do you capture people s attention and engage and involve Even when they don t know what they are looking for Inhales And one 1 of the reasons I came to Facebook pause was because I think Facebook has a really unique opportunity to fulfill that emphasis vision and fulfill that mission Inhales So our users tell us a lot about themselves mhm and they re telling us what they like what they don t like what they do And that gives us an opportunity to provide to work with advertisers to provide them information that s actually useful Inhales And you know everyone talks about targeting and everyone quick pause tries privacy to work on it We re working on it too and privacy And of course we mean it in a pause you know totally anonymous way but do we think we can use what we know work with users to pro use advertisers to provide things that are great for you users Absolutely Inhales But I think pause we have a s econd pause level which we can do Which is we think we can offer real engagement Pause So the dream emphasis of advertisers is to pause create demand for something and then let people engage with the products So I ll share one 1 example Pause Uh end of April Ben Jerry s does their free cone day mhm I guess they do it once a year or so Inhales And they did an advertising campaign with us Where we have these free gif these sponsored gifts and they sponsored the gift And they gave out two hundred and fifty thousand 250 000 cones which means users without paying a dollar could give cones to each other Mhm inhales So within a couple of hours two hundred and fifty thousand 250 000 cones were given out So Ben Jerry s bought another two hundred and fifty thousand 250 000 cones So within eleven 11 hours five hundred thousand 500 000 people had sent these free cones Inhales pause There was also a link to the Ben Jerry s store locator where it told everyone Today is Ben Jerry s free cone day Short pause You can come And people used our Events page to say Oh I m doing this and invite each other Inhales By the time this was done within twenty four 24 hours we think there was something like fifty three 53 million impressions pause on Ben Jerry s mhm Users telling Ben Jerry s on their page what kind of flavors they like People telling each other they were going to cone day Inhales facial expression pause I m not going to sit here and tell you all the advertising on Facebook has that property because pause no we both know they don t For me for some reason it s viagra You ll skewer me Yeah we know that We know that But that is the vision mhm And that s a pretty Facebook unique opportunity For a brander to create awareness and strive to specific user engagement  Kara Swisher  28 18 So Mark do you feel you have to educated advertisers in that way In terms of new paradigms or are you doing something very old like pause Here s I m building Inhales I think you re a media company more You often call yourself a technology company but you re med you re you re 14 12 we re definitely a technology company your defin Zuckerberg smiles and he the Audience and Sandberg laugh Okay you re definitely a technology Why are you not a media company Pause    28 35 Inhales Well I I mean i it depend on how you re defining a media company I mean I think we r  Kara Swisher  28 38 You re building an audience and selling that audience    28 41 Sure I mean  Kara Swisher  28 41 You re keeping them entertained Zuckerberg smiling in some fashion or keeping them pause occupied and long pause happy    28 45 I think we re primarily building technology Laughing and smiling  Kara Swisher  28 48 Okay Explain that Explain that    28 49 No I mean I think we re building a lot of products in different ways that people can share information mhm Right I mean the focus that s really important with these internet companies pause that the focus continues to be on the product and and on pause right engineering and and the technology behind it  Kara Swisher  29 01 So it s the tool the technology tools are your media  Kara Swisher  29 05 That makes you a technology company And would you compare yourself in a technology company to Google Are you a pause Google like technology company or    29 12 Um I mean I I don t know  Kara Swisher  29 15 Well what Smiling what you mean How how would you define I m interested in how you would define what technology companies is today going forward    29 19 I think it s one 1 that s mostly Swisher nods focused on on building technology and building pause building things  Kara Swisher  29 24 Building pause technology pro online yeah technology products Alright let s talk about u u but in terms of changing the face of advertising is it are you going to do something very slight emphasis different pause or or finding you re going to have to educate advertisers in a lot of ways Do you feel like it s using something different or the same kind of thing Zuckerberg inhales to start talking pause in just a new formats    29 41 Well I mean it s a lot of the broader trend that that we ve been talking about today quick pause in terms of the product Are are the the broader promise that Sheryl was speaking to but I I also think there is this process of bringing people along for that and and moving from where we are today towards that So I mean turns to face Sheryl Sheryl can probably speak more to that  Sheryl Sandberg  29 56 Yeah I think pause this is what people have always wanted It is short pause shaking her head goes back way before the internet You know what do you do if you re in marketing You create awareness of a product then you try to get users engaged then you try to move them on down the funnel to trial to experimentation to use to repurchase Runs out of breath at the end of sentence inhales Right What we re doing is Pause We are a technology company bringing technology to that So pause so very quickly going back to the Ben Jerry s example or pause you know the Indiana Jones example We did a free gift for that inhales pause last week pause for the opening Pause We brought people to awareness sure Indiana Jones opening send the free fedora go to the movie okay And so it s technology speeds everything up That s what we ve seen Inhales We think technology can speed up pause the interaction between advertisers and users short pause in ways that s really good emphasis for users Pause okay And that s let where we re really focused  Kara Swisher  30 37 Let me talk about two 2 more problems Change Change of what you are doing You re changing the Platform Can you very briefly tell us what what that means right now What is what is the Platform gonna look like and how uh people are going to complain no matter what we changed the comics Don Graham can tell you in The Washington Post and we had Sandberg laughs protests for years You know Sandberg coughs we we moved Nancy which is never funny and it was like pause I don t know the Crisis of pause 1983 Inhales So what uw uw what do you what do you going to do that s gonna sort of change it and how do you feel people are going to react to what you re doing there    31 06 Inhales Well I mean the the main thing that we re doing is pause if if you look at the original short pause version of Platform that we had It was very focused on developers building these boxes that could go in people s profiles right and then users going in and installing the boxes di fferent boxes in their profiles  Kara Swisher  31 20 And moving boxes around    31 21 Yeah and and I mean short pause one 1 of the things that happened was that the the Platform just grew so quickly and there are so many applications that people installed a ton of these Pause Right and pause um long pause the uh pause We found that a lot of the focus for developers was just on getting people to install these short pause these different boxes as opposed to pause actually creating a long term engagement inhales short pause and pause we want to make sure that that the application short pause developers are in sensitized towards building inhales applications that are actually inhales um trustworthy to users They go back a lot emphasis and pause engaging to users so we re we re moving the system away from this box based system to more of a system where when activities happening it can go people s pages and and right people approve of that  Kara Swisher  32 01 So you re going to have this sort of tab kind of tab kind of thing Nodding    32 03 Yeah so the net effect of I think of the the new iteration of Platform is going to be that inhales pause applications that are more engaging and that users trust more are going to be the ones that spread through the system more They re going to get more distribution They re going to be in people s pages more Inhales And pause I it s also just going to help people share information pause a a lu pause a lot more easily through pause through Feeds as opposed to through these boxes  Kara Swisher  32 23 Okay Let me get another chance change within your company I ve watched a lot of companies Netscape AOL all of them change emphasis slows down How is the entrance of Sheryl you ve just hired Elliot Schrage from Google I m not sure who you re hiring from Google next inhales but um wha what uh wa wa how is that how is that is that hard on the earlier people I mean even though you are a very young company can be very vexing to early people as you shift emphasis What s gonna be different now You re bringing much more professional co un un yeah managers    32 51 Pause thinking facial expression I mean I think its just its scaled really quickly Long pause Um long pause I I don t know Turns to look at Sandberg What s the change that you ve seen since you ve been here  Sheryl Sandberg  32 59 It s hard for me to compare the short pause yeah nine 9 weeks I ve been there before But I think the emphasis company pause is emphasis scaling really quickly and people want pause you know pause to make their jobs great and to build great products And pause finding ways to bring you know some of the things that we re working on is changing and improving our recruiting process mhm That s gone over very well Pause mhm We ve tightened it up we ve shortened it You know we re trying to make sure we re hiring the best people doing thorough reference checks et cetera and shaking her head and one 1 shoulder shrug pause I think that s helping people get their jobs done faster And that s obviously what we re trying to do  Kara Swisher  33 27 More of the trains run on time kind of stuff  Sheryl Sandberg  33 29 Yeah Side head bob And and execute  Kara Swisher  33 30 Cuts Sandberg off Which you re well known you I ll have to say  Sheryl Sandberg  33 31 And ex Well you know yeah I m glad to be well known for that because I think that s important You can have all the vision in the world but as we saw from so emphasis many people sitting on this stage pause the people that have you know pause earned emphasis their right to be on stage by building amazing emphasis companies It s about having a vision and then about execution Inhales And that s really what we want to do is one 1 shoulder shrug both  Kara Swisher  33 48 Let s talk about that vision and execution Pause A are you pause are you interested in selling to Microsoft Your company For fifteen 15 billion dollars    33 54 No I think you know that by now Smiling Sandberg laughs  Kara Swisher  33 56 I know that I know that You what are you interested in pause interested in IPO Exactly strong emphasis what are you interested in or do you    34 01 Inhales No I mean I think  Kara Swisher  34 01 Cuts Zuckerberg off If you if they walked up to you and said Fifteen 15 billion dollars  And you have long pause nodding had a set of them I ve gotta say You ve really have with have withstood a lot of uh  Swisher Audience and Zuckerberg laughing Zuckerberg smiling You I mean you ve withstood a lot I I would have been gone way way back Sandberg and Audience laughing Zuckerberg smiles And in France right now Sandberg laughing So um what i u They Fifteen 15 billion dollars  Steve he he Zuckerberg wets his lips says impersonating low gravelly voice We re coming We re coming We re coming Fifteen 15 billion Audience laughs    34 27 Smiling Well well I mean I think the the goal of the company is to just uh uh execute on some of things that we talked about before I mean just helping pause people pause become more open and share more information  Inhales pause Um long pause that that s the goal Pause Right so  Kara Swisher  34 39 Right but I m coming coming coming with fifteen 15 billion what    34 41 Smiling So so how does that help us Right  Kara Swisher  34 43 Does it    34 43 So pause so I mean I I The goal the end goal for us isn t to sell the company or to IPO I mean the way that we evaluate things like that pause are just How are they going to help things along the way Right And what we are building is pause actually what we care about  Kara Swisher  34 56 Can they do can they sell that company without your say so    34 59 I don t think so  Kara Swisher  35 01 Yeah Zuckerberg smiles Swisher laughs a little Okay Then lastly what do you wake Audience and Sandberg laughing Zuckerberg smiles You don t think so You d better find out Zuckerberg nods I ll find out for you from all my sources there Um Go for it Smiling Okay Um I believe so I think they can t do a thing without you Um pause many people could learn from you I think Um in that regard Um so in terms of um the Microsoft Yahoo situation Zuckerberg swallows how do you look at that I mean do you you are you going to be a part of that A part Do you see you your own one short pause one point six 1 6 percent And we saw the little movie It was cute  Zuckerberg small smile Do they call you a lot Do they Sandberg laughs Zuckerberg smiles What is their role in your  Sheryl Sandberg  35 33 No it was a joke  Kara Swisher  35 33 No I got that  Sheryl Sandberg  35 34 Calling card Yeah  Kara Swisher  35 34 No I don t think they call you at all But um  Sheryl Sandberg  35 36 Well they call sometimes Zuckerberg turns to look at her  Kara Swisher  35 37 Okay What is the what is the Zuckerberg turns to look at her relationship there With a giant emphasis pause company like Microsoft    35 42 Well Turns to look at Sandberg  Sheryl Sandberg  35 43 One 1 shoulder shrug when Zuckerberg turns I guess I took the last trip up there It s it s good I mean I think they are very  Kara Swisher  35 46 You re just went up there right  Sheryl Sandberg  35 48 Nods smiling I did just go up there  Kara Swisher  35 48 I know that was unusual for you Correct  Sheryl Sandberg  35 49 Smiling Well coming from Google you don t spend a lot of time at Microsoft So it was my Sandberg smiling and laughing with Audience It was my first trip okay I was with someone from Facebook and pause he said to me Well we go here And I m like Which way is that And he says Well you ve never been here And I m like No no I just spent six 6 years at Google Pausing after every word Right We don t pause travel to Microsoft all that often Inhales Um short pause but pause it s a good partnership I mean I really believe and I think short pause that Google experiences teaches you as well that you shaking her head can t go it alone No company can go it alone And one 1 shoulder shrug we re a small company I mean we re five hundred and fifty people 550 four 4 years old and

I mean that s that s like somewhat of a focus for them So I mean it wouldn t be good to to talk to them about some of that kind of stuff  Kara Swisher  37 52 Talks over Zuckerberg What is your viewpoint of opensocial pause and how do you pause expect to deal with opensocial    37 56 Inhales Well small one 1 shoulder shrug I mean I think pause swallows uh thinking facial expression for for opensocial pause we um pause I don t know We ll have to see how that evolves It s still it s still kind of getting started inhales um our Platform is is mostly focused at this point on just helping people build different applications so that users can share information in different ways okay Right and and Stops  Kara Swisher  38 16 And what let me ask you what motivates you I know you have the no apartment with the thing What do you what do you imagine yourself in five 5 years Pause Right now    38 23 Smiles In terms of  Kara Swisher  38 24 On your thirtieth birthday pause here you are That

Sandberg  38 39 You can give it back to me  Kara Swisher  38 40 No I m totally not giving it back to you It s under twenty five 125 dollars I m sure Go ahead Pause Wher where do you imagine yourself in five 5 years And then we are going to open it up for questions    38 48 Swallows I I short pause I don t know I just feel that we re closer to achieving our goals as a as a company In terms of helping people short pause make make themselves more open and and share more information  Kara Swisher  38 56 Talks over Zuckerberg And do you imagine having another company    38 58 Um shakes his head I I don t know Probably not  Kara Swisher  39 01 Probably not Video audio repeats from Zuckerberg saying people short pause make make themselves more open  Kara Swisher  39 10 All three turn out to the audience Sandberg smiling Swisher pointing and waving her arm around the audience Okay Questions pause from the audience There s gotta be good questions for Mark and pause Sheryl Long pause  Barry Sonnenfeld  39 16 Hi Sheryl looks toward the speaker smiling  Kara Swisher  39 18 Oh good Audience laughs Zuckerberg and Sandberg smiling You  Barry Sonnenfeld  39 20 Uh yeah Un Barry Sonnenfeld uh Esquire columnist and straches head pause film director  Kara Swisher  39 24 And all around Gadsadline  Barry Sonnenfeld  39 26 Uh yeah Um clears his throat pause growing up uh long pause I was a you know I was taught about the right to privacy it was it s a big government thing You know anti government and all that And swallows pause I just wonder pause if your site pause My fifteen 15 year old daughter is on your site all the time pause and has no emphasis sense of pause privacy the nature of privacy and in fact goes out of her way to publish everything about herself Sandberg laughs a little So I wonder inhales so a certain extent pause down the road short pause do you feel that we re creating a generation swallows my daughter s generation and the generation after that where inhales there ll be no sense of pause fear of pause government fear of uh invasion of privacy I know you have certain abilities pause to pause prevent people from getting on anything In a fundamental pause way do you feel that we re creating a sad dreary future for our pause children  Audience laughs video goes to Zuckerberg smiling and laughing  Sheryl Sandberg  40 24 That s even true  Kara Swisher  40 24 And and let me just uh There s also a question from the internet Hannah from Boston asks  What measures is Facebook taking to curb the bullying emphasis that leads to violence on your site  Sheryl Sandberg  40 34 That is very  Barry Sonnenfeld  40 34 That s a that s a different question  Kara Swisher  40 36 Sad and dreary violence What Pause What are you doing about it    40 38 So I mean I actually think it s the opposite of that I mean there are different ways to get to pause to a world where people are sharing more information about themselves and and I mean one 1 is short pause is pause through pause having pause people pause basically get hed force on them Right Which is the the government thing that you are probably talking about Inhales But I mean the the world that we re trying to build towards is one 1 where people have control and are sharing short pause this information because they feel comfortable and because inhales they re connected to all these people around them and are able to effectively share the information that they want And and one 1 of the things that inhales pause that makes it so that people can pause can share a lot of information inhales is that the site is setup so that people aren t sharing all of their information inhales with all the more that seventy 70 million people on the site Pause Right so I mean the people on average have pause you know a network or two 2 and are sharing information with maybe a few thousand 1 000 people I mean you know a lot of people put on their cell phone number and the reason for that is because they can say I only want to share this with my friends and I don t want to share emphasis this with everyone on the site Inhales pause And um swallows in terms of using the the privacy settings and things like that sharp inhale even though it might seem like pause like your daughter isn t paying that much attention to privacy inhales pause a huge amount of our users are tweaking their privacy settings in different ways So it s actually really pause fundamentally part of the site  Kara Swisher  41 48 And you feel so that you caught the violence of bullying You ve heard stories of that Sandberg nods On my every every site has MySpace has had issues Zuckerberg turns toward Sandberg Do you feel you have a short pause a a a role as a pause sheriff Swisher sets down card or a Town Hall I I don t know what a mayor  Sheryl Sandberg  42 00 Inhales I mean we certainly have role in making sure our site is secure and people are sharing information appropriately and we are pause controlling that information with emphasis them appropriately giving emphasis them full control of what they want to share Inhales pause You know obviously the interactions between everyone pause from fifteen 15 year old teenagers to others short pause run the full gambit Pause From saying Hello to things that are considered bullying Inhales Uh one 1 shoulder shurg we think we ve become useful for communities to monitor monitor that pause themselves emphasis mhm That these things have always gone on Facebook actually brings them to light inhales pause more rapidly and we ve seen a lot of pause distinct communities schools taking action around that to enforce their own policies Talks behind Sandberg Right Which we can enable  Kara Swisher  42 36 Points out into the audience Over here  Allison Sheridan  42 36 Allison Sheridan from Raytheon I ve uh read an article recently that said one 1 of the fastest growing groups in uh Facebook is I think it was thirty five 35 to fifty 50 year old women Sandberg laughs and uh even though I m more than double your age Inhales small smile Um are you guys I m I m in Facebook and I love it in there and I m having a lot of fun with my sad dreary children that are in there Um quick pause Audience laughs my like me Audience and Sheridan laughing  Sheryl Sandberg  42 56 Hey that s my age group  Allison Sheridan  42 57 Smiling There you go So my question is are you guys doing anything to to try to build things that would draw my friends in because my generation my friends shrugs aren t in it But but I d love if my my direct friends were  Kara Swisher  43 06 So pause beyond Pick Your Zit pause Sandberg laughs for example the lovely widget that is always my favorite to point to What do you what do you have for her Pause Mark Camera goes to Sheridan Sheridan smiling  Zuckerberg  43 14 Well I mean a lot of the theory is that pause what we are doing pause is pretty applicable to people a ll over the world and and of any age Right I mean everyone has friends everyone has pause acquaintances business connections people that they are connected with and they need to communicate with these people and inhales it s good to just be able to have a sense of who these people are Sheridan says something not miked So I mean there are going to be specific applications that are going to be built for people in different demographics And and in different countries across the world Inhales And a lot of that is happening on top of Platform So I mean one 1 of the really interesting things is um wets his lips pause you know I just travelled to a around the world for a bit and I stopped in in E Istanbul And I sat a a cafe and I was watching pause a a bunch of people use Facebook a lot confused facial expression of people in Turkey use Facebook And um pause there are lot of local pause applications that people have built there pause that pause are are just things that that make a lot of sense for Turkish users and I didn t understand them smiles because I don t know the language Inhales But but I mean pause uh le that s a lot of the goodness of of what we are trying to get at with Platform Pause Right it people people can build a lot of applications in these different places for different types of users even if we haven t gotten to that yet  Kara Swisher  44 16 Did you reveal yourself to them I m just curious Sandberg smiling    44 19 No No I wouldn t have even have known how to do that  Kara Swisher  44 20 Impersonates a male voice with an accent I am  Wear a cape like um starts pointing out into the audience Bill Gates Bates wanted wanted to do  James Wakim  44 25 Hi James Wakim Inhales Mark you ve talked a lot about your focus on the Development Platform inhales can you share with us three 3 Facebook apps that you would like to see that don t yet exist today Pause    44 38 Sure Smiling and nods Swisher laughs Let s do it Um pause looking up the his right thinking I think that some of the some of the more long pause th ematic things that that people all across the world are pretty interested in inhales pause um pause how about Something for sports would be would be really interesting I mean that s not something that Facebook has built but it would be inhales pause uh but I A ton of people all over the world are interested in sports Inhales pause Um maybe something more for politics Maybe something for religion I mean we haven t really focused on anything for helping people connect around religion but I mean that s huge thing across the world RIght so inhales I think an application around something like that helping people share information in that way inhales could represent a huge opportunity for a developer but would also be a really interesting ways for people to connect and share information Slight nodding  Kara Swisher  45 21 Yeah Religion ifizes yourself That would be really great Alright Thanks Looking out into the audience point That s a great idea actually Right here  Arthur  45 25 Hi I m Arthur I have a question regarding you you were talking about branding longer pause and what your brand was about And pause and you were saying and congratulations to you uh you ve opened your Platform to everybody How open are you pause uh when you look at companies like Ning which is social media which is sharing information which is all about opening up their Platform How open are you emphasis pause uh or how tight are you to your Facebook brand Long pause    45 57 Inhales Um pause I mean I pause I think it s it s relatively open but it s it s definitely increasing as as time goes on Right so pause so it depends on what you are focusing on and what we re focusing on pause for the first version at least was on helping people make the same types of applications that we could internally Right so complete parity there on Platform and then making it so that people could build these types of experiences so that people could share more types of information Inhales There there are other types of things that we are definitely going to need to build into Platform before uh lots of other types of applications can be built and I mean some of that s going to come in the next couple of months in the next version of Platform as Kara was talking about Inhales pause And it ll just hopefully continue for the next period of time  Kara Swisher  46 38 kay we are going to do quick two 2 last questions  Jim  46 40 Hi uh Jim Mann with LA Times I ve been on Facebook for a long time I have a lot of fun with it And I I pay attention to my privacy settings and I got my my IM address up there and cell phone and stuff like that And I m okay with sharing now with just my circle but all these applications that ask me to pause you know pause I have to grant them access to my information I m curious out of three hundred thousand 300 000 developers What are they doing with all that information Do you have policies in what they can and can t do with it Do you police it and have you have you caught anyone doing pause untoward things with their information  Sheryl Sandberg  47 13 Inhales Yeah so we um when you download an application uh you are pause have the option of giving that developer your data not all of your data and that s in order so that they can build the experience you want So some of that data is necessary so that they can do emphasis whatever that application is doing Inhales We ve really strict policies about what short pause developers can do with that data Strict policies against about storing trick strict policies about transfer that data Inhales Um we have seen you know violations Those get suspended we uh capture the data Um but for the most part it s something that the community respects Inhales If you are a developer and you are working with us we offer a really unique opportunity to you to build Short pause Some of our developers had you know short pause small companies most of them that they can go to As Mark said it s like millions of users overnight So they really have a lot of incentive pause to kind of play by the rules Particularly around things that would you know knock them out of the network and not One 1 shoulder shrug give the access Pause That s a better long term strategy than trying to disobey  Kara Swisher  48 10 And do you actually police them Nods Mhm Can you actually police them  Sheryl Sandberg  48 12 We do And the community polices them for us Trust me  Kara Swisher  48 15 Okay  Sheryl Sandberg  48 16 We hear about everything  Raul  48 18 Clears his throat Hi uh I m Raul Um pause I ve been using Facebook for a longer pause for a short pause while now Probably two two 2 years basically Inhales And um after uh the acquisition of my company I was I joined HP and I found Facebook to be a great tool to meet at HP But more to that other person s point after the acquisition of my company I ended up with five hundred 500 extra air quotation friends Swisher laughs Um but I don t really need know Sentence said with hesitation and pausing being polite Audience laughs But pause it s it s side smile you know and and when you talk about sharing information I m not really sure what information I am sharing with them other than you know what s on my Facebook Inhales Uh you know with the people that develop the applications and that sort of that thing I guess my question is pause is there a way you can have Friends and Acquaintances Pause Sandberg starts talking Or colleagues Without  Sheryl Sandberg  49 06 Yeah There is Yeah yeah I mean it s used Friend List We have that Talking over each other  Kara Swisher  49 08 Would that be   49 08 Yeah a Friend list  Raul  49 08 Yeah but you see that friends list    49 09 Cuts Raul off Top now Friends Smiles and kind of laughs  Raul  49 10 Top now Friends Yeah okay  Kara Swisher  49 12 Okay but the idea of Facebook fatigue Sandberg and Zuckerberg turn to look at Swisher The idea of too many when does it become unmanageable This social graph that you talk about Because I m I have hundreds of people I m I don t know who the hell they are    49 21 Well I think a lot of our job pause is to make it so that pause as people become more connected with with more people and are sharing more information that becomes manageable Right From the flipside of sharing all of this information pause is that there have to be tools pause for people to filter and get to the information that they want right And this is why we built Newsfeed Right it s I mean there are thousands of updates  Kara Swisher  49 38 Cuts Zuckerberg off Also becoming unmanageable I mean again as it gets bigger it s become especially when you put ads in it Does it how do you I mean better Search better wha I mean it does become sort of Long pause Zuckerberg starts responding Enveloping    49 49 Yeah I mean I think I think a lot of what what we re moving towards is just giving people better tools to pause to categorize people Sandberg nods categorize the types of information that they want But I mean that s a big part of of our job Is to help people inhales manage all of this flow of information and and all the people they want to share this information with  Raul  50 05 Well okay One 1 Okay Very quickly Yeah One one 1 quick thing on that So you added the new Friends thing Where you can go and categorize your Friends and whatnot I still find it pause somewhat confusing because it still says you have six hundred 600 something and um you know on the on the main pause pane Inhales And then the other things is if you want to have like a few Friends over or you want to send an e mail to more than twenty 20 Friends you have to kind of make multiple Groups of Friends to do that Right To be able to manage that So anyways I just  Kara Swisher  50 31 He wants better navigation  Sheryl Sandberg  50 32 Yeah And I So do we   50 33 Yeah Yeah  Raul  50 34 Yeah something like that  Kara Swisher  50 36 And we we well you have to do it Audience starts laughing  Sheryl Sandberg  50 37 We re working on it Audience laughs Zuckerberg and Sandberg smiling and laughing  Kara Swisher  50 39 We don t really care what you want Um last very very quick question Cause we re exhausting this poor audience  Male Audience member  50 43 Smiling Yeah alright Sorry This is a quick question relates very much so to the last one 1 Triggered by Inhales And that is if you look at the history of the web long pause you know we started off as catalogs you know that s what Yahoo was Then we shifted to a Search based pause metaphor Inhales pause And pause you guys are building uh kind of a new category of web page about a people as opposed to about about subjects Inhales short pause And you know I guess is is you know all the things that you are describing are around better tools for categorizing pause managing you know this these lists but uh at some point doesn t it flip over into becoming a much more Search metaphor Inhales And pause you know how do you shouldn t you be getting ahead of the game there Pause    51 26 Well I mean we ve had Search that s pause since the um pause since the first version of Facebook that had almost nothing Right I mean it didn t well even have Messages Pause  Male Audience member  51 34 Well Yeah But but I m thinking you know just you know Yes There s always been Search but you know Google really said Search is it man Bang Box So if I went to Facebook for example and said I just want to find mm some set of people associated with a topic Or I want to find some set of people who pause are associated with a company Or I wanna find you know some set of people who I ve interacted within the past Those are a very very different kinds of Search than find a emphasis person pause by emphasis name Inhales And you know I m just wondering how Search plays into any emphasis ecosystem that gets big enough that you could know about Kara Swisher  52 07 Talks over and cuts off the Audience member He s saying that you get big enough you know I was searching for Barry Manilow fans the other day and he was ten 10 screens Sandberg smiles down pause my club you know what I mean I m sorry I was Zuckerberg smiling and little laugh Sandberg smiling I ll admit it Long pause How do you get better as your ecosystem gets bigger And then let s pause go on out of here    52 21 Turns to look at Sandberg Yeah I mean that that seems like a turns toward Swisher reasonable pause like pause theory on on how that would evolve I think I think as they the amount of content gets better we have to big wha gets bigger we have to get better at filtering and helping people search through it  Kara Swisher  52 31 Great Zuckerberg nods Thanks Mark So much I really appreciate Audiences starts clapping you coming Reaches to shake hands with Zuckerberg '}\n"

      "{'filename': '2008-005', 'content': ' Speaker 1  Music Applause Uh now uh things have changed dramatically I d like to bring up  who now wears tennis shoes Laughing Applause Mark Inaudible 00 00 20 You can sit you don t have to you don t have to like you can come closer there I won t bite   All right  Speaker 1 Um So Mark You remember the first question I asked you last year   Oh yeah  Speaker 1 I asked you how s the financing going   Yeah and I said We re going to close it next week  Speaker 1 So let me ask you how s the financing going Laughs   Um Well you know I wish I could say the same thing as I said last year So last year we were basically right in the middle of of discussing ad partnerships with a bunch of companies and um as you know we chose we we went with Microsoft and did this advertising partnership which has become a much broader partnership where we now work with them on other technology as well including search which we launched most recently And we took an investment from them and um you know the terms of that were were really good really favorable to us So what we ve been doing is I mean we as part of that round we just have have had the ability to to take more money and you know as time has gone on we we ve considered it you know It it s not clear that we really need it at this point so um it s not really clear that there s going to be anything to announce but that s basically what I think you re reading about  Speaker 1 Trips to Dubai   I ve never been to Dubai Apparently it s nice this time of year  Speaker 1 Gideon must have told you that That s the CFO Laughs   Oh Laughing  Speaker 1 Okay we can move on Do you need money   No Laughing  Speaker 1 All right We ve got that one checked   No we do not Um No Um  Speaker 1 Um 00 02 00 We we spoke uh before this and thank you for taking the time so that so that I don t surprise you with anything Um Uh And one of the things you told me uh with regards to to the discussions around money was that you re not primarily focused now on optimizing for revenue but there s been a lot of discussion and articles written recently saying that you might need to worry about that faster than you thought given the economic climate Uh True False   Well well here s what I d say So I mean 2008 has been a a a year where we ve mostly focused on growing the user base Right We we ve gone from around 50 million users at the beginning of the year to now more than 100 million users Right Inaudible 00 02 44 we had 100 million users a couple of months ago and you know now we re already at around 125 and it s just growing really quickly And a lot of what we ve done is is made it so that we can grow internationally So there s a a team at Facebook that worked on the international strategy and basically what they did is they made it so that all the language on the site um all like 300 000 words it s a really language intensive site because of things like News Feed could just be translated by by people into their native languages And um we just opened it up and made it so that people can translate it themselves and it s just been a method that s worked extremely well So we we started off with um we we have more than 20 languages available now and there s just a whole lot in the pipeline but that s been I think by far the primary focus this year And that s what I ve been talking about a lot And I think as I ve been talking about growth and how that s just a really important strategic thing for us we want to make it so that everyone across the world can share and and connect with the people around them Um one of the things that I that I ve also said is that you know while we re doing this growth is our our top priority Um we re we re not as focused on optimizing revenue but I think in the past I ve really understated that and um and I think some people have taken that to mean that you know we don t have a revenue strategy or we re not building anything like that at all which is actually completely wrong Right I mean while we re doing this we have two very 00 04 00 strong revenue lines um both direct in in brand sales and um online sales which you know the the online channel we launched last November That and um I mean both are doing really well And with on the direct side we um we work with more than two thirds of the the top 100 advertisers in in the US to have really interesting brand experiences and we can talk about that in a bit if it if it s something of interest Um One of the big focuses as we ve grown across the world is just opening up new offices in all these different places Um So we ve just announced we re opening uh one up in France Um We have had one open in in London for for a while We announced one in Dublin Um So just kind of expand that effort And then the other big story has been the the online channel and you know now we have thousands and thousands of advertisers who are just coming to the site and um putting in their credit card and targeting this exact people that they want to reach and um and they re having pretty good results with that  Speaker 1 So how does it break down I mean can you give me a rough is there one that s like you know Do you have a Popeye arm on one side like direct and kind of a 90 pound weakling arm on the other or is it roughly the same amount from your online versus your brand direct   So I m I m not going to get into a lot of very specific numbers just because  Speaker 1 But just tell me the percentages   Yeah No Well a percentage would be a number Laughing Um There um I mean I what I d say is that they re both strong and they re both growing very quickly right So and the they re growing in different ways I mean  Speaker 1 Your revenues generally are in the hundreds of millions   Yeah I mean that s something that that we ve said hundreds of millions in revenue  Speaker 1 So let s break down then that a a third line of revenue which I ll call Microsoft Um When you did the deal it was a very big part of your revenue mix right   Um Earlier on it represented a larger portion and what we ve done as time has gone on is we ve just wanted to make sure that that we had a greater control over over the different levers right So at this point it s um I mean it it s still millions of dollars but it s a um but it s a a much 00 06 00 smaller part of of the revenue than than either of the other two pieces  Speaker 1 Right Do you think Steve Ballmer is happy with the price he paid   You know I mean I think the deal was about more than the investment Right I mean that s the thing that everyone is focused on but it was really a partnership where you know first we were working with them on ads Now we ve worked with them on on a bunch of other things um just including you know contact portability between the sites Um Most recently we re working with them on Search And what we found was that they ve been a really good partner for us and um and you know some people are surprised by that but but I mean the reason is because they re in a place where they really want to to try new things all right and take an innovative approach to advertising and Search And some of these markets where they re clearly not the incumbent right So um so they ve been a very good partner in terms of fit for for what we re trying to do because we re also trying to to build news things And um and I think we re both pretty happy with with the rate at which we re experimenting with new things The the investment was just something that we wanted to do um in order to to tie things a little bit closer together um but but I think that the main thing is just the products that we re building and we just continue to roll out new things  Speaker 1 But do you think Steve s happy with the price he paid   It s not clear that that s why they made the investment  Speaker 1 Okay   So I mean I think a lot of people obsess over the price Right  Speaker 1 I m sorry   And no no Not just you I mean it s like it s something that I ve that I ve had to um you know a lot of questions about this over the last year since we did this and um  Speaker 1 Well it was 15 billion dollars    Laughs  Speaker 1 I mean it was a lot of money and and and I think it took everybody by wow One of the things I think that raised some concerns was how are you going to particularly now in this economy ever grow in and pass that price It sets a certain watermark that you don t want to have a down round You don t want your employees feeling like I m never going to get liquid Right   Yeah but I mean I I don t think that taking money at a certain price necessarily sets the strategy of the company 00 08 00 Right I mean when you re when you re going out if you re going to take an investment you want to take it on the best terms that you can get We felt like we got favorable terms It was at a very good point in the market right in in terms of just the macro economy and you know It just made sense for us to do I mean in terms of going public I think we ve stated pretty clearly a bunch of times that we aren t planning on going public for a few years I think that s pretty much decided for us at this point because of the macro economy but I mean but besides that like I I mean I think that that doesn t change our plan in any way And I mean I I don t think that we don t feel any type of pressure to live up to 15 billion dollars I mean obviously we want to do the best that we can do and we believe that we re going to build a really good business You know If if we can succeed in making it so that everyone across the world or even a very large percentage of people are are using Facebook and all of the different applications in in the development community to share information and connect with the people around them then I mean that s a really powerful change in the world and and uh we think that we can couple that with just building a really good business around that but I mean on a day to day basis there really is no thought into okay we need to do this to justify a 15 billion dollar evaluation And I I think that there s been a lot of attention around that but I mean as a private company you know the day to day evaluation is just something that we have the benefit of not having to worry the oscillations of especially in an economy like this where I think it it s a really difficult thing for larger public companies you know that and and their employees you know  Speaker 1 Oh no dude Jerry seemed to think it was a piece of cake yesterday   Well I mean well not just Yahoo I mean I I think I think all these companies right I mean there are tons of companies where you know the stock is down whatever it is 50 this year That s just  Speaker 1 Yeah Well I didn t really rid Paul Otellini this morning but his stock is down from 28 to about 16 so it s not easy anywhere right now That s for sure Can you remind people how many people work at Facebook   Sure I mean it s a it s a bit more than 700 at this point and the breakdown is it s like oh  Speaker 1 And I uh uh uh for whatever reason I just assumed that you guys had been hiring like mad and you were like in the thousands Um What what are the plans this year 00 10 00 Do do you have a hiring freeze on   No I mean we re we re really continually hiring really good people You know and um so I mean I think the the key emphasis for us at this point is just hiring really great technical people Right I mean that s that s always the most important thing so so engineers great folks in tech ops great designers um product managers I mean the the people who are building things right who are going to help us continue to grow and and build just the the different user products and the different revenue products and the platform products that we need That s that s the core I mean we re also really aggressively expanding the sales effort um especially internationally And I mean the strategy there has basically been first row in a market then if we re succeeding there and a lot of people are using the site to to share information there s a good eco system around it then we ll we ll kind of go in afterwards and we ll we ll couple that with having a sales officer where we where we can then sell things And I mean that s been a different strategy than other folks I mean some companies have put a sales office in before and um sometimes that s worked or not but I mean but we re basically you know I mean there are countries now where take France for example I was just visiting It s really exciting there because it s around seven percent of the population is on Facebook and um and it s kind of at this inflexion point where um you can really see that if it continues growing at the rate then the next time I go back maybe in a a year or so it could be like 25 or 30 of the population and so it s it s um So we figured that was a good time to get started with an office there and good expansion there But I mean those those two areas are the main places that we re hiring but I mean but we re really careful  Speaker 1 We should hook you up with Lance Armstrong and maybe you guys can conquer France together Laughs   Yeah but I don t bike  Speaker 1 Um Let s talk about Connect uh Facebook Connect Um Uh It was uh announced It s been announce for a while You re in a sort of period of working with partners in in a sort of closed and it s going to be open soon   Yeah and we just announced that anyone can now apply so so yeah So we we basically had the closed beta and now we re opening it up and then 00 12 00 we re working towards the fully opened release  Speaker 1 A criticism of Facebook whether it s true or not that I d like you to respond to is that um it s a walled garden uh that you jealously protect that social graph and you don t want to for example join open social and and and be part of a broader distributed web How do you respond to that   Well I I guess the the main thing that that I would say is that there s this very clear transition that normally happens from closed systems to open systems Right So in in a mature environment I think a a lot of these technical systems end up being pretty open but they also need to start somewhere Right So um so I mean I I think we ve taken really big steps in terms of opening up the industry Right I mean we we were the first ones to launch face we launched Facebook Platform to just become 00 12 57 the first social platform and kind of spawned all all this development and then you know I mean some of the other initiatives that that Google has had and that others have had are are really good and I think they re really interesting Um Over time I think that there it s worth exploring how the companies can work together At this point they re much smaller than Facebook is um just independently So um and also just from talking to developers we ve gotten a lot of feedback that that people prefer using our interfaces like FBML F FBJS and you know I mean that may not always be true Right I mean I think over time whether it s open social or something else or whether ours becomes the open standard I think you know I mean these systems tend to move towards openness over time I mean one one example that I that I think about is like if you look at the PC industry and how that came about Um You know I think uh it s pretty uh commonly held belief at this point that the reason why Microsoft ended up being such a strong company is because they instead of trying to own the the whole computer top to bottom they instead just went and and tried to build this operating system so that people could build 00 14 00 software and plug in any type of hardware below and that that would be basically like a more open system And I think it s pretty easy to to overlook the fact that that wasn t the first iteration on how that kind of development worked Right I mean in order for Microsoft and and the software model with with Windows to really make sense first someone had to be building computers and creating demand And then it got to a point where it really made sense for that to happen So I think the the challenge that we have is to bring people along that whole path Right so first get people onto Facebook and make it so people can be comfortable sharing information online Right I mean think we take for granted that four years ago when Facebook was getting started most people didn t want to put up any information about themselves on the Internet Right So we got people through this really big hurdle of wanting to put up their full name or real picture mobile phone number in you know a ton of cases um connections to real people and the way that that happened was by building really good privacy controls Right And then crosstalk 00 14 55  Speaker 1 They re not always used I I I have a Google News Alert for Facebook and and today it showed three people who got fired because of what they put on their profile including a Patriot s cheerleader and a backup center for the Texas Longhorns a bad day for stupid drunk Facebook photos Laughing   Well the privacy controls are there Um Anyhow Laughing The the the point is um so I mean so as time goes on people have shared more and more information and there s this clear trend towards that  Speaker 1 Right   And we we looked at at where things were last year in in 07 and just realized that you know each of our applications whether it s photos or groups or videos or whatever it is kind of represent one way for people to share information and we just realized that there was no way that we were ever going to be able to build all of the different applications and ways that people wanted to share information So therefore we we built this platform and um and over time we just expect it to get more and more decentralized Right So the next iteration of platform in in a pretty big way is Facebook Connect as you mentioned Right And it it s basically going from making it so that 00 16 00 most of the development on Facebook is happening inside Facebook com with with canvas pages and and boxes and profiles and items and streams to instead people can now have all all the same tools but they can make it on their own website They can build their own brand have their own site right And have all the same integration with Facebook as they got with the original Facebook platform And I just think as time goes on we ll just see this very natural fanning out and and decentralization of things and um and I view it as a big part of Facebook s role in this ecosystem to just continue pushing that Right Continue making it so that more people around the world are sharing information so that people can bring their information to all these different places but inaudible 00 16 40 there s a rate at which this will happen and if we re not on on the edge of pushing that out then I don t think we re doing our job  Speaker 1 Well you ve got a really good I think I think you know there wasn t anybody and I think I said this last year who who who wasn t when you announced the platform everybody rushed into their into their meeting rooms and said What what are we going to do How are we going to take advantage of this What are we going to build Um a year later a year and a half later um I think there s a sense and I think it s fair to say that the platform has not lived up to all of its potential um in that there are there s a very there s a head head end of the platform some very successful developers but there isn t a very robust kind of neck and shoulders or torso or whatever you want to say Um There s been you know uh some criticism from parties here around uh the idea of you know we can t throw sheep our way into the next version of of of you know of Web 2 Is Connect an attempt to address some of those limitations of the platform   Well I think we made a number of changes earlier in the year and Connect that I think are just important evolutions Right So for for a number of reasons in the first design of the site and and and with platform what we basically did was published a lot of information about people who are adding 00 18 00 different applications just just once All right And um what that did is it kind of skewed the incentives in the ecosystem towards application developers trying to get people to add their application instead of actually trying to build uh applications that created a lot of active engagement in sharing All right So you get this dynamic where there would be a lot of applications that  Speaker 1  Crosstalk 00 18 19    people got to to add themselves once and then the box would just be in the person s profile for a long time um basically acting as an advertisement for that application forever So what we did was we changed the whole model so it s more feed based now Right So now the amount of distribution that an application gets is directly proportional to the amount of engagement that it s creating and information that it s helping people share And what that basically did was it took this set of applications that were out there and it made the ones that were created a lot of active engagement in sharing grow at a much faster rate and and just have a lot more success There are a number of examples out there that are that are pretty clear to see Right I mean  Speaker 1 Well what are the ones that okay Give us three or four that you think are are are good examples   Well within recently just with the election I mean what s happened with Causes is like that is a really interesting example just how they were using status and news streams  Speaker 1 It s growing very quickly Yeah   Oh yeah No I think it s growing at hundreds of thousands of people a day Um but but I mean uh the flipside of that is also frankly that a lot of applications that were being developed that weren t using Facebook in a social way and were really just using to get boxes in people s profiles those have seen a decline in growth and I mean when we were going into making those changes we knew that and and we kind of we made a conscious decision that this would be a better ecosystem that we wanted that we thought we were moving towards and we just realized that you know we kind of had set up platform in a way that we knew we were going to have to iterate and we just decided to to make that change Um Facebook Connect I think is a really important change as well All right So what that is is instead of being anything involving really user interface so right around boxes or or canvas pages is people can make their own websites completely and it s basically people can now use their their Facebook identity and connections and bring their friends along with them as well as any content they have on Facebook to any other 00 20 00 site Right So that is is a somewhat different approach in that it eliminates all the the other things the the other parts that were there and just makes it so that it s inherently making a site social to now plug in to Facebook Connect So we think that um that the the partners that are working with us on Connect are going to be very rich applications and I mean we took a a slightly slower wrap up period with the closed beta that we ve had just to confirm that um just because we were completely blown away by the adoption of Facebook platform in 2007 Right I mean the fact that we launched it and within a week there were applications that have millions of users and within months there were hundreds of thousands of developers who were really humbling to watch but it also we we learned from that that we we want to do stuff in in a slightly more controlled way just so we don t have to make these painful changes that often And um  Speaker 1 Mm   And I think uh our our hypotheses for how Facebook Connect to play out seem to be going pretty well  Speaker 1 How do you and your partners make money with Facebook Connect   Well it s um it s not a very direct thing So I guess what I d say is like for the first version there isn t anything necessarily associated with it that s going to be revenue generating although there are clear derivative effects where if people are using their Facebook account and friends and information all over the web then there s also a clear correlation with how much they re using Facebook and the the whole model is ad driven Right So I m just like with Facebook platform um there is the question of how are we going to make money How are people going to make money I mean the model there was we didn t provide any proactive tools We figured that the ecosystem would and it did but also we made it wide open so that people could run their own ads or um you know have payments or do whatever they wanted And we also just put an ad there and we made money off of that So I mean we make money just depending on how people are using the site and engaging with it and sharing information and you know I think the same is going to be true here  Speaker 1 Let s talk about the uh the online ad piece Um It was a year ago that you you rolled it out Um Uh 00 22 00 engagement ads right And I think now most of us in this room who are on Facebook how many people I mean how many people everybody raise your hand if you re on Facebook I m assuming that it s yeah There we go Just checking By the way raise your hand if you re on Twitter Is Twitter just a feature of Facebook   Oh that s tough Laughing Um I mean I think they re doing really good stuff I m I m really impressed by it by what they ve done Laughing  Speaker 1 And   Is is it a feature I mean uh I think that they re building something pretty cool  Speaker 1 Okay   Yeah I mean I I I  Speaker 1 Is there a build buy spreadsheet in Gideon s office around Twitter   A build buy spreadsheet I I don t think the CFO makes analyses of buy of of crosstalk 00 22 42  Speaker 1 Okay   Um We re we re a building driven company  Speaker 1 Help me out Who whose office is that in   Um But We we don t it s it s all it s an open floor plan  Speaker 1  Laughs   Um So so I mean I think what I d say is I mean we have all we have status updates and wall posts and these types of things too I think that they ve done a really good job of making it it s a very elegant model Right  Speaker 1 When am I going to see is Twitter one of your partners for Facebook connect   Yeah  Speaker 1 Awesome Um Let s move on Um Let s get back to the uh the engagement ads So most of us are probably now used to seeing our friends show up in the ads on the left or the right you know and someone endorsed this or someone bought that Um Is that the model or where is it going to go and how are marketers responding to that and what kind of marketers are they Right Are they the little guys like what happened with AdSense where it was just this boom in small business and then the big guys came in later or are you know Who are the advertisers that are drawn to this and how s the community responding to it   So the ones that we re mainly working with now this is more on on the brand side for for this point Um And you know I mean the ads perform pretty well but it s um I mean it s also really early So so we have the second iteration right now where we we basically launched last November this um 00 24 00 the the online channel Right And the first version of engagement in social ads and now we we basically the the ads that you re pointing out on the home page  Speaker 1 Mm    are the second iteration of engagement ads which I mean they have something built into them right there for people to share information or pass something along And you know I mean those it s a really big jump off of off of where we were before And you know I mean the the basic reasoning behind it and the thinking is you know advertising on the web and and in social environments is less about just hitting someone with a message and more about just a two way dialogue in engagement or a multi way dialogue Right So when people come to Facebook they re they re not necessarily going to just to to see some message or see some news What they what they want to see is what s going on with their friends and the people that they care about and the people that they re subscribing to So um when um when someone sees an advertisement or a piece of content take for example a movie trailer and they see a friend who s commented on it and and has you know either said that they want to go to the movie or they find it interesting or even you know something interesting that they found about it even if it was negative Um That makes it so that people are way more likely to engage with that ad Right So we ve seen just a number of interesting examples of this I mean there s a lot of of stuff that we ve done with entertainment I mean yesterday there was a really interesting example that we did with the New York Times on the election where um they they basically had had this engagement ad around the headline for Obama Wins the Election And um they made it so that people could pass that along as as a gift and a piece of content and more than 200 000 people did that in the day And um And a lot of people can also um companies and users can can make these pages right which are basically ways to engage with people on the site and that s free So the New York Times had one of those for for a while and it had you know tens of thousands of of of members on it but just having this ad for one day alone more than tripled the the membership of that and and got a lot of conversations going on different videos they had so it was and I think that it was it was a really interesting case for them where they got a lot of benefits  Speaker 1 We have a lot to talk about and not a lot of time 00 26 00 Guys if you want to start uh coming up to ask Mark a question or two please please do Um I I want to ask you about something that s come up over and over in the last couple of days which is um uh Facebook being banned uh by enterprises Uh uh we had the CIO of the Army saying that Facebook was a problem uh for the Army because of course everybody generally in the Army is young and they want to be on their Facebook accounts but there are issues with that any number of issues with that Um And Paul Otellini showed a very interesting enterprise application that looked a lot like Facebook uh but he said it doesn t have the security or the you know firewall understand there s a there s just all sorts of stuff that makes Facebook not good for like Intel to use as an internal group uh platform for Intel employees for example What do you make of that market and and and are you addressing that   So enterprise crosstalk 00 26 54 specifically  Speaker 1 Are you concerned about that   So we ve actually seen anecdotally a trend in the other direction All right So there are industries like the the banking industry for example where you know they have to really closely monitor um any communication that that employees make So originally their take was just block Facebook completely right because it s this communication thing And now anecdotally what we ve heard is that a lot of people at those companies instead what they re doing is they re making it so people can use Facebook but then anything that s a direct communication whether it s chat or or inbox then that you can t do at work But I mean but they ve moved in the direction of making it so that people can actually use Facebook at at work And I think that that s because you know a lot of people are seeing that that it s just really valuable to have this kind of communication between people I mean there are even these examples where where a lot of folks are are either making people take time out our encouraging whole divisions of companies to get on Facebook and then direct in that way And it s not really that surprising So at Facebook we have a lot of internal tools that we use to communicate inside the company And rather than like traditional enterprise tools that are pretty hierarchical kind of you you force people to fill out different things whether they re like projects they re working on 00 28 00 or whatever it is The the tools are basically built off of the the same type of incentive systems and structures that the the site itself is built off of where um where basically you share information You get feedback Um That makes it so that people are basically incentivized to share more information and it actually ends up being this really robust internal communication system where people are constantly sharing ideas  Speaker 1 Mm hmm Affirmative    and and collaborating on different things in the company or you know talking about what they re working on and getting help from other people And to me you know Facebook right now isn t an enterprise company and we don t have direct plans to to get into any of that stuff anytime soon but just seeing that as a as a prototype and just a a a case of how that stuff is working just really gives me a lot of confidence that someone will build something really good in this space  Speaker 1 I have one more question Then we ll go go to questions here And this has to to it it sort of I m going to attempt to wrap all of it in one Um We talked about your engagement ads We talked about Connect Um and the idea of of exporting a feed of your social graph and your actions and content on the on on on Facebook out into the world and creating applications around that If I m Google I d love to check that out I d love to get a feed As a matter of fact I d love to encourage everyone at Google to take my Facebook graph so that I can make AdSense for Facebook Um Is this why you re not doing open social   What I I m not sure I understand I  Speaker 1 Well I I I just think I don t I I there is a chess game going on right now Is there not   I mean I I think people make this out to be something way more dramatic than it is Um  Speaker 1 Well that s my job We are on stage Laughing   Fair enough  Speaker 1  Laughs   Um Yeah so I mean what I d say is I don t think that anything is motivated by by that Right And I think it it s really easy to see to to kind of point to different moves that the company is making think that it s that But I mean there are really complex challenges around um either privacy on on the one hand making it so that 00 30 00 the the two platforms can interoperate and just the willingness for the two companies to do that um and and kind move in a in a common direction over time and and I expect that a lot of these problems will be solved over time but I also intrivialize them Right So I I think it s there there s just a lot going on and um and I would expect that over time we definitely see this as a very clear trend of people sharing way more information online and people sharing more information openly with more people And I I believe that we ll get to this point where the majority of people are comfortable sharing a lot of information pretty openly with with large sets of people And then you can have public streams and things like that And you know and I think as as Facebook has has kind of gone and and developed over the years we ve definitely moved in that direction more but it s also built around this core of people being able to control exactly who they re sharing information with  Speaker 1 Mm hmm Affirmative Mm hmm Affirmative    and that that s going to be an important thing Um Then on the platform side I think it s you know it s just it s really early Right I think platforms like this take years or decades to even develop And I I think what they re doing is really cool I think what we re doing at this point is is much bigger and from the feedback that we ve gotten people prefer a lot of the interfaces that we have But but I mean I think that you know I m not necessarily saying that as time goes on and we wouldn t want to work with them and I don t think that they necessarily don t want to work with us So I think um it s just it s an exciting area that s developing and I think we ll just have to see how it plays out  Speaker 1 Yeah Wow Uh We ll be watching Um Question over here  Speaker 2 Hi thank you so much for coming and my name is Valentine I m with thoughts com Um My question was uh when you came you started talking about how you guys are planning on going to different languages and everything else I was wondering uh in the future do you guys have a plan for retention of members   Well this has always been one of the interesting stats about Facebook is that you know I mean out of all the active users right which the the vast majority of of of people who are on Facebook are are active which the the stats that we give are active users So people are using it within 30 days 00 32 00 And then we ve always had this this pretty amazing stat where around 50 of the users are active every day So um so we don t do anything specifically to focus on on like getting people back to the site What we do is just build a product that we can help that helps people share information and connect with people And you know the the belief is that that s such a strong trend that s happening in the world and it s kind of been playing out over the last you know any number of years and just going to continue going on in the future that if we continue building stuff that basically makes it easier for people to share information a platform that makes it so that people can share information all the different ways that they want on any device that they want um with exactly the audiences that they want and there s a lot of development that needs to happen in all of those places then I would expect that you know next year people will share twice as much information as they are this year Then the year after that they ll share twice as much information as they are next year And you know and that just means that people are using Facebook and applications in the ecosystem more and more right and maybe like less that will be on Facebook com and more of it will be on mobile phones or on other sites or things like that but I think you know as long as the stream of information is just constantly increasing and we re doing our job and and our and our role and kind of like pushing that forward then I think that you know that s that s just been the best strategy for us  Speaker 1 All right Well we have time for one more  Moya Glad it glad it s me Hi Um My name is Moya and I d like to ask something about something that s really like incredibly current um relevant for us right now that I m struggling with We speaking of causes and elections and stuff like that had a created a huge presence on Facebook with a page um around a political uh topic a ballot initiative Proposition 8 and it grew to be 140 000 members and it s just a huge adoption Now that the election is done Proposition is over um we have to figure out what to do So my question is do you see pages end of life or morph or change I mean people change but 00 34 00 they change their their faces but we have to figure out how to keep the community or change it So I d like your opinion   Well I mean I think we ve seen a lot of examples on Facebook of people organizing just in interesting movements for things that they want Right And there s there s a lot of just casual social use of people staying connected with their friends and family And then there are really interesting examples of um when people organize just really large scale protests or things like that I I m not saying that this is a protest but but I think you know just organizing large amounts of people whether it s in the Causes application or if it s groups there are also pages Um and and I think a lot of people have used these things very successfully whether it s you know to try to overthrow different regimes or to try to lobby a company against some policy that they don t like Um and and I think people have had pretty varying success with these and I mean some have been just phenomenally successful and um and so I think that the tools are definitely there to do something like this  Speaker 1 Yeah Don t don t stop working on that That sucked    Laughs  Speaker 1 Well Prop 8 was a   Yeah  Applause  Speaker 1 Um and by the way Facebook was a big supporter of the no on 8 00 35 17 so thank you for that not that I m getting political or anything but hell it s the season Um We re out of time I m getting my own people are yanking me So um Mark as always thank you very much for your time Thank you   Yeah Thank you Thank you  Music '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2009-003', 'content': ' Matt In five short years  has turned his social networking website Facebook into a global phenomenon To friend someone update your status or write on a wall is the language of the 175 million people on the website Facebook  Female It s kind of an addiction for me  Matt Created in a Harvard dorm room back in 2004 as a way for students to share information online Today from politicians to a lot of curious parents Facebook says it s gaining users 5 million users a week  Jessi It caters to everyone who is interested in sharing any type of information with other people on the web  Matt If it were a country it would be about the size of Brazil Recently parodied on Saturday Night Live  Female Facebook break laughing  Matt Inside the company Facebook s growth is taken very seriously Facing tough competition the site is still searching to find a successful business model and its users are asking questions about their privacy online  Jessi Who owns our data when we put it out on the web Who owns it when we put it on Facebook  Matt Earlier this month  the founder and CEO changed the Terms of Use for the site to read the company may retain archived copies of your user content  Julius Say in ten years you know I want to run for President of the United States or 20 or 30 years Anything I have on Facebook now since it s owned forever they could do whatever they want with it  Matt Sparking outrage some say Facebook was claiming ownership of personal photos and information  Ben They just basically had a major PR flameout on our hands and they had to step in and put out the fire  Matt After quickly recanting the company s now also giving users unprecedented governance over the site  is Facebook s founder 00 02 00 and CEO He s here for an exclusive interview  it s good to have you back   Oh it s good to be back on the show Thanks for talking to me  Matt I want to talk about some of the stuff we just mentioned in that piece in a second but let s let s talk about sheer numbers to begin I mean it used to be I thought when you first started this there was more of an exclusive small core of people using this and it had this incredible cool edge With 175 million people using this around the world can it retain its cool   Well it s definitely grown a lot and now there are people all over the world who are using it including about a million a week uh new people in the U S alone are signing up so I mean people are using it just to communicate and share information with their friends and the people around them so um everyone s just using it for their their small circle of people  Matt So let s do the math here You say a million new people a week here in the U S along You re going to hit 200 million users then in the near future   Oh hopefully soon yeah  Matt If I have a Facebook page can it be cool I mean I I I m not self deprecating here but am I the kind of person   You re cool if you don t have a Facebook page  Matt I was going to say the opposite but I mean do you want the moms and dads of the world out there Is that really your target audience now   So the idea is really that um the the site helps everyone connect with people and share information with the people that they want to stay connected with and that s really something that s applicable for everyone So it started off with young students and now we have people all over the world in all different age groups and different demographics are using the site and I mean that s something that I think will continue to see growth  Matt Let s go through this controversy OK because it did kind of explode here There there is this fear that after you released this statement that seemed to indicate that what people put on their Facebook pages picture content information would be retained in the archives of the company A lot of people freaked out about that  and and since you ve modified that explain to me exactly what the situation is now   Sure so there s there s the terms of that that the site is governed by and um and you know frankly we made a mistake in the last version and and issued some unclear language You know our intent is that people own their own information I mean that s one of the things that makes Facebook 00 04 00 really special is it s a service that people are using to put up information um that they want to share with people that often is really personal private intimate and one of the big differences that that Facebook makes is it gives you great controls over who you share your information with so  Matt So if I have a Facebook page and I put on that page pictures of myself me and my wife my kid information if I decide to take that page down and not be a Facebook user in the near future all of that comes with me you don t keep it in some archive   Yeah so what will happen is that none of that information will be shared with anyone going forward right and so I mean you control exactly who you re sharing that information with so you can say I want to put up this photo but I only want to share it with these people in my family or these friends from high school And you know you once you if sign up for the site and then you decide you want to take that information down then none of that information will be shared with anyone going forward  Matt Let s talk about business There are reports that that the that this company is still not breaking even and what shocked me when I read that was with 175 million customers how can any business not make money What s the explanation for that   Oh well I mean our business is actually growing really well like we have a few different lines that are growing well I mean for the last few years we ve been primarily focused just on serving users helping people connect and share and helping it spread all across the world and continue to  Matt So do you have plans to grow the revenue substantially   Oh it already is growing very quickly and I mean especially in this economy we re very happy with how it s going  Matt I m just getting used to people talking about Facebook in the office around here and now they re talking about Twitter and things like that so I really have a lot of catching up to do How does the competition from things like Twitter etc change the way you view your business in the coming months and years   Well you know there are a number of services online that help people connect with people around them and share information with them and you know Facebook offers a number of ways for people to do this It s by far the biggest place on the web that people are going to share photos I think there are more than a billion photos shared a month on the site Um people are also using it 00 06 00 to to share messages with people and one of the big differentiators is just that people have really good control over who they re sharing their information with So um for example you get these cases where there are soldiers who are overseas in Iraq who can post specific information that they want to share with their families right and people can do this because they have really good privacy controls on the site  Matt Did you ever dream 2004 in your dorm room in Harvard when you started this thing that you d end up sitting here one day saying we re about we re going to go across 200 million users   No I think that s a pretty difficult thing to foresee you know I mean when we starting it I figured that there would be services like this that would help people share information and connect in in these ways I mean I knew that would be a really special service for people but just no idea that we d be the ones who were kind of helping to build that  Matt Man you started something big  it s great to have you here wearing a tie this time I should say Last time I think you were in san you were in flip flops and and some kind of like fleece thing so you you really kind of fit the bill now There you go That was from when you and Meredith in 2007 Look at you Mr Serious CEO  it s great to have you here   Thanks  Matt Thanks very much '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2009-004', 'content': '  We re gonna open up governance of the site and put in ultimately a vote which means that people will have a say and be able to give any feedback they want on the rules and regulations like govern how we develop the product So the reason why we re doing this is just because it s a service that people are sharing really personal and intimate information on and um it s just becoming increasingly important to more people We just past 175 million users So we figured that you know in addition to helping people share information and connect with people that we should also open up the process on how the site is governed in order to make it um just a better process for everyone  Becky So who is going to own the Facebook content the person who puts it out or you   The the person who s putting the content on Facebook always owns the information and that s why this is such an important thing and why Facebook is such a special service that people feel a lot of ownership over Right This is their information They own it and they crosstalk 00 00 51  Becky And you won t sell it   They often wanna no of course not I mean they they wanna share it with um with only a few people like when I upload a photo or album I only wanna share with a few members of my family my friends from high school and you know it s really important that on that information only goes to those people And you know people feel a really strong sense of ownership over that which is why it is um really important to to say you know we trust our users and that s why we re gonna open up governance like this  Becky You say there s a contradiction between people wanting to share information online and wanting to control it Why  Well I mean I think you know everyone wants to be able to see all the information that s out there and at the same time everyone wants to make sure that they re only sharing their information with the people who they want to see it So it s important that we design a system where people can do both Becky So just to be clear You re not going to sell or share any of the information on Facebook   What the terms say is just we re not gonna share people s information except for with the people that they ve asked for it to be shared and you know everyone gets privacy settings which it it has always been one of the big different differentiators for Facebook and what s what makes it a really different service for people was you can say you don t want this photo album to go to this people I want this note to go to these people And um the the privacy controls on Facebook 00 02 00 are really unparalleled by anything else  Becky But how are you going to make money if you won t sell or share people s information   The model is advertising Right And people s information is their own but there are a lot of different companies and and entities that wanna buy advertising to take the information that they have um whatever their message is and and reach more people with it you know So our advertising is really growing quickly just because the number of people using Facebook around the world is growing quickly All right So we just past 175 million users Pretty soon we ll pass 200 million So with that you know the advertising revenue is growing as well  Becky But all the people are so outraged because they perceive you as being a private site That s how you ve made your money   Well I feel like people have a very unique relationship with Facebook where you know most other services they they re privacy is an important thing but on Facebook privacy is central because people are sharing their own information So people feel a very strong sense of ownership over it and when they perceive that that we do something that they don t want then they are very open about giving us feedback Which is why we went out of our way to set up this governance system that encourages them to give feedback and makes it that more transparent I think a lot of the reaction that you re seeing is more of a reflection of how much people care about Facebook and what their relationship is with it and how much they trust us '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2009-012', 'content': '  Hey Thanks for all coming out today It s an honor to be here and to have that chance to talk to you guys So I m only going to talk for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and then I want to be able to spend the rest of the time answering your questions So I have a brief history of what we ve done with Facebook and what we re trying to do that I ll get started with and then just take a bunch of times to take your questions Figuring out how the click All right so for you guys who are aren t familiar with what Facebook is trying to do our mission is to give people the power to share and to make the world more open and connected So what we mean by this is that more open world is there s more information available people can have access to more information you can see what s going on with the people around you and more connected means that people can stay connected better with their friends and family people immediately around them but also people all across the world who otherwise they wouldn t have a good means of staying connected with right So a lot of these is not just your immediate friends and family who you might spend a lot of time talking to normally but people who you might meet once or twice and would want to stay in touch with but wouldn t normally have a good way of staying in touch with people you meet when you re traveling things like that And we want to make it so that Facebook is a good product for being able to stay in touch with a lot of people at the same time So this is kind of the purpose of what we re trying to do We think that if we can succeed in helping people share more information then that will be a really valuable service that can help make the world a little closer together and more connected Umm actually before we jump into that So because we re So this is an entrepreneurship program so I figured I ll take a few minutes just to talk about kind of how we got started and what my situation was 02 00 when I was at Harvard when I first made the first version of this and started thinking about this stuff So one of the questions that I got a lot of the time is you know when I started Facebook was I thinking that it would get to be the size that it is now and the answer honestly is no no way You know when you re sitting in a college dorm room it s really hard to imagine that you could ever build something that s gonna reach 250 million people But it was really interesting at that time So I was a sophomore at Harvard I was studying computer science and Psychology which is kinda a set of things I m interested in I ve made things since I was pretty young just loved playing around with computers but also was really fascinated by how people reacted to things and how people s minds work which is why I wanted to study Psychology Um so there were couple of things that were going at the time that I made Facebook or the first version of it in my sophomore year On the one hand you know when I first started sitting down to build Facebook which the first version was extremely simple It was just it took a couple of weeks to build not because it was some amazing engineering feat but because the first version was pretty simple It had all it had was a profile with some very simple information in it You could add people s friends you could search for people basically look people up and find some information about them but not a whole lot There wasn t messages there weren t a lot of photos there s just one photo things like that It started off very simple And I made it cause I wanted to have an ability to just see what was going on with people around me at Harvard Population 6 000 students So I want to build look people up and see whatever information they wanted to share about themselves And in order to do that we built a site that basically made it so people had a good easy way to put up some information and control the information that they put up have privacy controls all that So it started off as a pretty simple thing But at the same time You guys are all in university so I mean one of the fun things about being in university is you know people talk a lot about how they think the world is gonna play out and abstract 04 00 concepts about they hope the world can be and how the next generation will be changed And one of the big things that people talked about during my time at Harvard was how the internet was gonna bring about more transparency and more access to information So this was around 2004 when I got started For the last you know 10 years before that we d have the web right since kind of Netscape and first browsers were built during the early 90s And since then there s just been this increase in the amount of information that was available an increase in people s access to information and that had really changed a lot of industries right So got businesses like Napster that made it so that people could share files for free and that really challenged the traditional content industries At the same time you had a lot of information being started to be made available about people And you had search engines that were already pretty prominent so you could go and type in your name online and find out a bunch of stuff about yourself but you had no control over what people were saying about you Right in search engines There were all these links that there might be information about you but you can t really change that So one of the big questions that people talked a lot about was how this how this kind of increased transparency would play out and what would happen when there is more information available and how people would negotiate building their own identity managing their reputation managing their privacy And that s actually a lot of what Facebook was grown to address So it was kind of this interesting time when I was getting started where on the one hand I was surrounded by a bunch of friends and colleagues who were talking about some of these issues that I think are pretty important philosophical and generational issues for us and on the other hand it just kind of started off as this really simple thing for college students So this is our mission Take a brief look at some of the stuff that we built So for those of you guys who aren t familiar this is a profile page This is mine I don t typically look at the site in Portuguese I don t speak Portuguese very well 06 00 Laughs But I figured I m coming here so we might as well brought up the site in Portuguese You know the profile is really the core of the site because it represents who people really are On Facebook they are their real selves the majority of the time And that s a big thing that separates it from a lot of these other services is people put their real first and last name they put a real picture of themselves They put their real email address A lot of the time people put put as well like a cellphone numbers something like that the real birthdays and things like that So anyhow so here are some of the big milestones over the last five years as we ve been building Facebook In the beginning I talked about that that s me and my roommates in college in our free time together We all look like we re about 14 years old And you know so basically what we did was launched it at Harvard first It got big pretty quickly more quickly than we really expected Then all of a sudden all of these people from other schools started asking for us to launch Facebook at their schools so for about a year we spent time just kinda launching Facebook at more schools Started off at other schools on the East Coast and spread it all throughout the US and other schools primarily English speaking because this site was only available on English at that time And then people started asking for different features in the product So we added things like groups because we saw that we just basically watched how people were using the product and we saw that people were creating profiles for sports teams and organizations on their campuses And we re like All right this means that there s a demand for people to create groups on the site So let s just program in a function so that features that people can create groups instead of having to make fake profiles of the groups So we did that And then we watched how people were using it and we saw that there were set of people who would change their profile picture every few days to something new And at the time we only supported one profile picture So 08 00 this was assigned to us as we were watching that people really wanted to share more photos with their friends and they were kind of using this one slot that they have as a way to share a lot of different photos So one of the big things that we invested in early on was building out photos functionality and now Facebook is one of the biggest photo sites on the web So we basically spent a lot of the next couple of years building applications that either people asked for it explicitly or just we observed people trying to use the site in those ways and we collect a lot of data just on how people use the site and we use that to make a lot of the decisions as to what we should build So in 2006 we had a lot of college students and high school students on the site and we made two pretty big changes to the site The first was we decided to make it so that anyone could sign up and use it And the reason for this was originally when I was getting started I just wanted to make something that people could use to stay in touch with people at universities But we re seeing that as people graduated from university they still kept on using it People in high school were using it in addition to people in college People in colleges all over the US and even you know all over different places in the world were using it So we realized that this thing that we built was applicable beyond just universities It was applicable like everyone wants to stay connected with their friends and family So the product really made sense for people of all ages and all countries and we decided just to make it so that everyone can sign up And this was a real turning point for us cause we went from about 10 million users when we opened up to everyone to around 250 million users where we are today So that was kind of one of the big turning points for that In 2007 we launched the application platform which basically made it so that You know I was talking about before around 2004 and 5 we built a lot of different applications for this site and we kind of realized that there were so many different things that you could build that used people s friends or that basically that people wanted to use 10 00 that they didn t just want to use with themselves but they want to use with friends whether it s sharing photos or videos or playing games A lot of these different things are just a lot better when you re doing them with friends And we realized that there was no way that we d be able to build all of these different applications ourselves So instead what we ve decided to do was built a development platform which was made so that any developer across the world could just sign up without having a deal with us or anything like that and could build their own applications inside of Facebook And this program has been pretty successful So we now have almost a million developers building on top of Facebook including developers all over the world There are a bunch of developers here in Brazil And this is one of the main ways that the site gets localized for different countries There s an interesting story when we first were growing in Turkey It actually is a country that has a huge number of people on Facebook One of the primary ways that people were using the site at first was to play this online version of a Turkish drinking game that a local Turkish developer built So I mean a lot of the things So the things range from small things that people built in their dorm room for fun to large businesses that have hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue that are built on top of a Facebook platform But that was a pretty big turning point for us as well because they made us think there could be a lot more functionality on the site 2008 was pretty big because that was the year where we decided Okay we really need to make this available to everyone in the world and that means making available on every single language So I ll talk a bit more about that later but that was obviously a really important point because you know if we re trying to connect the world doing it in English doesn t really work so well I mean you can only get so far that way Now the vast majority of our users don t use the site in English so that s pretty cool for us And this year we built a lot of stuff that just takes advantage of the fact that now people are sharing so often and so many things on the site that it really starts to make sense to show the things that people are sharing in real time and sharing the most recent stuff instead of just kind of showing 12 00 all the static information about them So this is kind of an overview of some of the big decisions that we ve made as we ve evolved and I ll jump into a couple of them So just to go through a bunch of the applications on the site we started off with just one photo and you know since then more than a billion photos were uploaded to the site each month So I mean that s a really kind of crazy number if you think about it And we have more than 15 billion photos on the site total We ve had to build a whole lot of unique technology to deal with storing them and serving them efficiently that this doesn t end up just costing a huge amount of money for us still cost a pretty big amount of money But there s some cool stuff and a lot of it is open source So if you wanna check it out I don t know how many of you guys are engineers but there s a cool file system that we built specifically for storing photos called Haystack That might be worth checking out if you re into that kind of thing Well so on top of photos we decided videos should be pretty big after that I mean a lot of people have cameras that they re taking photos also use that to take videos And this is one of the products that s actually ramping up really quickly right now So more than 10 million videos are uploaded each month It s typically pretty different from the type of videos that you d find on something like Youtube where I mean Youtube is more videos that people want to share with everyone This kind of similar to how all of Facebook works The videos that people share on Facebook are more about things that you want to share with your friends or just the people around them People will take a video and attach it to a message as opposed to sending a video to everyone Events More than two more than two and a half million events are created each month It s the biggest events site on the web which is kinda cool 30 million people update their statuses each day That s growing really quickly A billion chat messages are sent every day And more than 70 percent of users use some application on Facebook platform So a lot of these things are different ways of sharing information 14 00 games things like that So a big reason why people are comfortable sharing all these information and this is one of the most important parts about Facebook that I think makes it different from a lot of other sites are the focus on user control and user privacy So we ve always had this philosophy that people will share a lot more if it s a safe and trusted environment and if they have control over the stuff that they re sharing That means I could put up a photo album and if I want to share it with just a few of my friends I could do that or if I want to share it with all of my friends and not my parents I could do that If I wanna you know just all these different types of things If I wanna have most of the information on my profile be open but I want to share my cellphone number but I don t wanna share that with everyone I only wanna share that with my friends but maybe not like a couple of annoying people then I could do that This ends up being a really important part of the site because if your only option was to share your cellphone number with everyone or no one you d probably share it with no one right But because people have control over exactly who they share it with people can feel comfortable sharing it with the right people and that creates a lot of value cause people are comfortable putting the information up The other piece that s important is if people want at any point in the future they can take information down So I mean if you want to change your interest or if you wanna If you wrote a note or posted a video and you don t want it to be out there anymore you can pull it down So just like search model that I was talking about earlier where if you type in your name into a search engine you see all these information about you and you don t have any control over it It s exactly the opposite on Facebook where on your profile your friends may have shared wall posts or you may have given them the ability to put photos there but at the end of the day you get the final say over everything that s in your profile And if you don t want anything to be there you have complete control over everything that s associated with you on Facebook And what we found is that that control just makes people comfortable sharing a lot more information So we ve spent a lot of time building up privacy settings This is basically just to show that 16 00 you can have different things visible to different people so Larry is my friend you could see those posts Okay over here there weren t those posts So this is just a graph of our growth It was just kind of fun I like to include this to every presentation laughing When I like wake up in the morning and look at our stats page I smile you know But then you could see some of the inflections right So late 2006 was when we did open registration It took a little while But basically this is like around the end of 2006 that we did open registration and then it started growing very quickly because we let anyone on it and then 2008 we really focused on internationalization We had a good amount of languages around here and since then just a lot of the world is signing up so pretty exciting So this is just a visualization that one of our designers did of the population of the world as Facebook is spread on Facebook So we have a lot left to go I think Sao Paolo is that yellow blotch down there so we got some strength going on down there So the mission isn t to give some people the ability to share and to make the world open and connected it s to make to make it so the whole world can be sharing information and can stay connected So in order to do that we ve placed a really big emphasis over the last couple of years on making sure that was really available to everyone all over the world So one of the main ways that we did this was by focusing on translating the site And most companies I think when they go to translated product what they ll do is they ll pick the few languages that they think are gonna get them the most reach 18 00 and then they ll translate it to those languages But we really wanted the product to be available for everyone to use across the world So instead what we did was we built this mechanism that instead of us trying to translate the site we built the system that users themselves could submit translations And this is made it so we now have coverage for the languages that 97 percent of the world s population speak So we started off with just Spanish was the first language and users translated that in two weeks And then French was the second language and the French users translated it in less than a day which is kind of cool And now there are just all kinds of different dialects as well So there s Brazilian Portuguese Portugal Portuguese I don t know what you call that why do you call it Portugal Portuguese laughing Okay There you go So this has been really important for helping the site spread to a lot of different places and be localized We ve also focused a lot on mobile applications So we have 250 million people using the product worldwide In the last year or since the beginning of 2009 our number of mobile users has doubled from a little less than 15 million to more than 30 million at this point So that s still a lot smaller than web and you know there are way more mobile users in the world than web users So this is growing at a faster rate and at some point I would expect that the mobile users will outnumber the web users But it s pretty cool what we re seeing there in terms of people using it for SMS and all different platforms and like there are really good applications that a lot of manufacturers and companies are building themselves say for example Blackberry basically built their own application and they ship it with the Blackberry now so almost anyone who gets a new Blackberry has the Facebook app there We also see that there are a number of users who just use the mobile app and don t use 20 00 the web app at all That s kind of cool and I think it s kind of a trend that we ll probably see accelerate in the future And then the last thing is Facebook Connect which is basically the next version of Facebook platform I talked about this for a second before about how we have There are more than a million developers or around a million developers sorry building applications on top of Facebook Now the first step was making it so that people could build applications inside Facebook and now the next version is making it so that people can integrate Facebook into any application that they want whether it s a website or a mobile application or a desktop application or even a game console And that allows people to bring all their information from Facebook and more importantly with their friends So the idea here is let s say you re shopping online for books You can go to like a bookstore online and you can just automatically see what books your friends have bought what they ve reviewed what they re interested in the site can tailor its recommendations to what books you ve said are your favorites And obviously this a really important part of this is giving people control over how they share this information But over time we expect that there will be just more Facebook integrations all over the web and in these different environments And one of reasons why I m down in Brazil now is to talk with a bunch of companies down here about integrating Facebook Connect Facebook Connect You don t need to deal with us to do this You can just go to the site and sign up and start using it so anyone who wants to develop something can do that and it s free So this is one of the ways that it s spreading as well And just kind of to close off with how we re doing in Brazil It s a pretty exciting time for us here We re obviously quite a bit behind of the market leader in social networking in Brazil right now but we re growing pretty quickly So we have 1 3 million users It s doubled in size in the last three months so we have quite a bit of momentum So we figured that now is a pretty good time to come down and talk and kind of 22 00 make sure that we had a chance of time to explain of what we re trying to do and that people could hear that You know what we found in a lot of the countries is we aren t the first everywhere right So there a lot of countries especially in Europe and the rest of Latin America where there was some company had a social network that was bigger than us before we got there before we were translated into that language And what we found is that if we focused on building a good product that over time if people like Facebook better they will switch over So it s not an overnight thing It might a year it might take two years it might take three years but we re really excited about the momentum that we see here and hope that you know people enjoy what we re doing and wanna use Facebook to help share information So that s really all I have for now This is a cool visualization that one of engineers made that maps out people across the world sending friend requests to each other and communicating with each other So thank you guys all for having me It was an honor to come and speak here I want to just take the rest of the time to answer your questions  Clapping  Female Now we are going to open for questions Please wait until Amanda takes the microphone unto you okay  Marcio Hello Mark My name is Marcio I study here at FGV I want to know how do you see Facebook five years from now What s your vision about it   So since what we re trying to do is make it so that people can share more information and stay connected what I hope happens in five years from now is we just continue to move along that and make more progress So if you go back five years for example people were sharing very little information online 24 00 And one of the reasons that Facebook first took was because of the privacy settings and people did not want to have information about themselves online and one of the reasons why they got comfortable using Facebook is because they had control and it wasn t being shared with everyone So over the last five years we ve seen a ramp of people sharing more information using services like Facebook and other social networks to stay connected to a wider circle of people I don t know if guys are familiar with this study called Dunbar s Number which is basically it s this guy who did the study of The number of people that a person can kind of maintain connections with and it s around 150 naturally And one view that people have of technology is that the point of technology is to extend some kind of human capacity So for example glasses or contact lenses extend your eyes and make them better So one of the ways to think about Facebook is that it should extend your social capacity So if we go out five years one of things that we hope to see is that people will be sharing more types of information right And we think that they ll be doing that both on Facebook the website but increasingly using mobile phones which kind of makes sense because if you have a device with you that you can use to share information all the time then you ll probably sharing more information A lot of that will also happen through developers building things on Facebook Connect right So there are all these different applications that we re not going to build ourselves but that other people will build and that some people will really good businesses around too And that Facebook will be a part of it because people will build applications and people will use their Facebook friends as part of those applications but that will be a big part of people sharing information So I mean I think like five years out we ll probably target having you know at least a million sites with Facebook Connect people sharing more information people being able to extend Dunbar s Number to be able to use stay connected with hundreds of people and kind of maintain a lot more connections and richness in their lives That s what we re going for 26 00  Female I m from Babson College Could you please elaborate on your revenue model I know it s a pretty widely discussed topic I would like to hear from you Thank you   Yeah totally So there are a bunch of different ways that we make money but the primary one is through advertisements All right so the business model is primarily around targeting advertisements that are going to be relevant to people through just understanding who they are better right So I was talking about Facebook Connect before and one of the main theories about Facebook Connect is that almost any product can be made better if you know who the person is that is using it right And I mean and it kind of makes sense in human interactions too right If you know who the person is that you re talking to you can have a better interface and you can have a better conversation with them So the same should really go for products If they know who you are then they should be able to present themselves better to you and the same goes for ads as well So if an advertiser knows or even the advertisers don t even have to know if we know what you re interested in then we match up the best ads in the system for you and that makes it so that you ll have a more relevant advertising experience and you ll try clicking more ads so that means that the ads will perform better for advertisers and that will make more money So one of the things that we wanted to make sure when we started off with this model was we wanted to make sure that people understood that the ads were targeted to them right Because taking using people s information that they put into the site and just using it to target ads Like if people didn t understand that then we wouldn t be so happy or feel that comfortable doing it But So we did a bunch studies on this And what we found was actually people really understand The vast majority of people have a clear understanding that the advertising is targeted to them which I guess makes sense because you know if you put in that you like a band like I mean I like Greenday for example 28 00 and then I get ads all the time that were like okay Here s Greenday is coming to San Francisco to play a concert do you want buy a ticket So it s not that hard for me to make the connection that I m seeing that ad because I said that I like Greenday But on top of people understanding that the ads are targeted to them people also report to us that they really appreciate it right Because now I m getting a Greenday ad which something that I might actually engage with and I m actually be interested in instead of just some random band from somebody who s trying to advertise And now if you re the person who s trying to promote that concert for Greenday it s a much better experience because instead of having to advertise so broadly you can just advertise to the people who said that they like Greenday So the advertising works pretty well all around it s ramping up really quickly We don t talk a lot about our finances because we re a private company So that s one of the cool things about being private is you don t have to constantly report on all these stuff But the numbers that we have said at the beginning of this year when people were kind of asking a lot about this and wondering how we were doing through the recession was our advertising revenue is growing 70 percent or more this year which is we re pretty happy with just given that the economic conditions and that we re going to be cashflow positive sometime in 2010 So we re pretty happy about that as well I m just from going from starting off in a college dorm room buying servers for 85 a month and putting ads up and then when we had money buying more servers too to building a service that is going to be able to support itself at massive scale so the targeted ads are doing pretty well for us  Male We are representing the work Father Steiner 29 43 where you work as an intern some years ago but we have a couple of web inaudible 29 48 or web sites in Brazil also I d like to ask one question In a point of view or an investor what s the best way to make a valuation of web inaudible 30 00 30 00 or website and if it s only based on future profit   I don t know I m not an investor Did you say you re from Dr Class 30 11  Male Yeah   Awesome Already does same people still there When I was at Harvard I worked as an engineer at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies as just kind of a day job to make some money So that was cool So how is it going  Male Awesome   Awesome So Sorry So you were asking about to value these companies You know I mean I don t even know how to value Facebook right I mean people always speculate about what the valuation for our company is and I always tell people in the company not to worry about it and that the thing to focus on is that if we re building a service that hundreds of millions of people are using and are finding a lot of value from and all these developers are finding all the value from and advertisers are finding a lot of value then eventually we ll all be rewarded for doing that But I mean the value I mean market valuations go up and down I mean as you see with the market in recession now I mean companies that are really no different than they were last year are valued at half of what they were last year So I mean trying to predict what the value is for anything is pretty difficult So I think what I try to do when I m deciding what to build is I just try to think about what are things that can be really transformative and exciting and that are gonna provide real value for a lot of people right So when I was talking before how we get started doing photos I mean it wasn t just like I decided that we should build photos of this you know a group of people who worked at Facebook we re looking at how people were using this site and you know people are going through these hurdles just to keep on uploading these single photos then imagine if they could just upload a lot of photos all at once and have a good interface to look at other people s photos So things like that And I think you can look at other applications and kind of get a sense of overtime who might use them how big they might get 32 00 It s a little more art than science But I m not really an investor I m a builder  Cristina So my name is Cristina and we have a big problem in Brazil regarding manipulation of power So how could you confirm that for instance through Facebook like Obama did I can elect someone and the election in Brazil it s like basically where all the corruption starts so how can I be sure that Facebook would not be in one side or another side but in the right side   Well this is a bit about my favorite But a big thing for Facebook is trying to be as neutral as possible right So we have really strong anti censorship policies Often we air on the side of having offensive content beyond the site because we just don t want to take stuff down unless like it really has to It gets used a lot Facebook gets used a lot in other countries around political things So for example most recently in Iran when people are protesting a lot of people once they didn t have access to you know SMS and a lot of those networks were shut down people used Facebook to organize protests and to stay in touch with their family around what was going on Now this isn t verifying elections or anything like that All that we can really do is make sure that everyone has an equal voice right So what we try to do is we didn t work with Obama or McCain or anyone specifically during the US election What we try to do is make it available so that and encourage all the different politicians 34 00 to use Facebook to share information and get their message out more broadly We figured that if we could do that then we re basically creating more transparency which gives people better choice and that s really the best thing that we can do But being a neutral platform is really important especially when we have just all these users who depend on it to be able to say what they really think all these developers who depend on it with their businesses and want to know that we re not just going to shut down their application just because we don t like it right So we really go out of our way to air on the side of leaving things on the side and supporting free speech and being neutral and things like that but in terms of elections  Cristina So I would like to know if you would like to do with me a soap opera the first soap opera because Brazilians they do it a lot And So   No Laughing  Cristina No I m serious What I m saying is that the opera can change the mentality of the people They can understand something That s basically what Disney is doing trying to manipulate people   Yeah no sorry I didn t mean to be so dismissive But I m a pretty shy person I like to keep a pretty low profile don t like being on TV that much  Cristina  inaudible 35 16   Computer soap opera Laughs All right we ll follow up  Male Mark I am a professor here and I was wondering you are a dropout from Harvard as well as Bill Gates What the universities are doing wrong to keep talents like you and Bill Gates on the track   You know I don t know if they re doing anything wrong I You know I learned a lot when I was at Harvard I kind of wished that I d been able to stay because I would learn a lot more I think arguably I learned a lot more doing this so I think I chose a pretty good path But Harvard actually 36 00 and a lot of these schools have these policies that allow people to take off as much time as they want And that actually made building Facebook a lot easier and so in a way they kind of encouraged it because I never had to make the decision to drop out of school What I did was I built the version of Facebook which is just pretty small where I had on the order of hundreds of thousands of users you know once we were spreading to a few colleges Then I moved to out to California for the summer And I want to do that just because I wanted to see what Silicon Valley was like but at the time when I moved out with my roommates I was fully expecting that I was going to go back to Harvard in the fall And what happened was we spent much of the time building out infrastructure launching at more schools we got to a million users and I was like it was so hard taking all these classes in the spring term and trying to manage Facebook  Now that Facebook s even bigger it s just going to be so hard so let s just take a term off and see what happens and it just grew more and then Look all right let s take another term off and let s see what happens and then we re like got some investments and we re like All right we hired some people we re like Let s take a year off a full year So and then like two years in we re like 10 million people I m like all this is going on so it s like We re probably not going back But even now I never had to make a final decision to say that I wasn t go back to school and that actually really helped out because if I had to decide at that time really early on if I was gonna drop out or not who know what I would have done It s like a really big risk I mean the site wasn t that big at that time and we didn t have this big of an aspiration early on It wasn t until we got to a certain critical mass that we re like Wow we can really affect on how people share information online at a really broad scale One funny story though is that in my last semester at Harvard Bill Gates actually came and spoke to one of my computer science classes and his message was that he encourage everyone to take time off to build stuff and to try building stuff and he s like You know one of the things about Harvard is they let you take off as much time as you want and then you can always come back so you know if Microsoft ever falls through I m going back to Harvard 38 00 So I mean one of the questions that they asked is why we moved out to Palo Alto instead of staying in Boston and I think that that is the real question for them that they need to work out because I think that they would have been really happy if we built Facebook like in the Harvard neighborhood out of Cambridge or Boston But I think that they re actually pretty happy that they have this program that they let people take off time to go do stuff  Amanda Hey Mark So students are submitting questions through live feed as well   Okay  Amanda So we have one from Manuel Bolem and he wants to know what your opinion or vision about the integration of Facebook with e commerce   Well so one of the things that I was talking about before with Facebook Connect is how almost any product can probably be better if your friends are integrated into it So if you take a site like I don t know what s an e commerce site down here that s big  Male Submarino  Amanda Submarino Laughing   Okay What do they do  Amanda Sell everything like Amazon   Okay Is there Amazon for Brazil  Amanda Yeah   Okay So think about you know if you went to that site which I m not going to try to pronounce laughing and then you can just click a button and then all of a sudden you can see the things that your friends have bought or it could tailor what it showed or recommended to you on its homepage based on what your interest were on Facebook your favorite movies books things like that that you ve put in I mean imagine that the homepage is probably pretty similar to Amazon what we have in the US where you log in and immediately they re just trying to merchandise all these stuff to you right They re trying to like recommend all these different things that you could buy Now what would be a better recommendation than knowing that your friend bought something and they liked it That s also the basis for our advertising system on Facebook I mean there s targeting but there s also the social recommendations 40 00 that are really powerful But I think that this ends up being a really powerful way for sites to integrate So whether it s e commerce or it s recommendations for like what restaurants or night club you should go to or anything like that people care a huge amount about what their friends are doing so being able to have more transparent and easier access to that will probably make it so that there are more transactions And the other thing that I think is actually kind of interesting is that more transparency It encourages people to get better products So we once we had this interaction where we were going to sell ads to someone in Hollywood who runs a movie studio And the person was kind of complaining that We used to before all the social media stuff be able to at least even if we had a bad movie be able to at least sell a lot of tickets in the first weekend before word got out that it was bad but we can t do that anymore And I m like Yeah that s good You know like it s good that words spread quicker now and that people can have more transparent access to stuff and can know even the first weekend that the movie comes out whether it s going to be good or not and the answer is make better movies right So and to the extent that this makes it so that people focus on building better products because there s more transparency I think that will just be good for everyone  Amanda Students  Male So does Facebook have any plans of expanding to Brazil and how would that expansion start You told us that you re starting to talk to some companies here but do you plan on having an office here do you start with sales people or development What s your idea for the expansion here   So everything that we do is really focused around people using the site So developers and advertisers kind of come later Now we have Because there are over a million people on the site 42 00 that s kind of enough for a bunch of developers to want to build things But we aren t really so focused on advertising here yet We re much more focused on building a good product and helping people share information first So the basic formula for us is we want to make it so that it s translated into whatever languages are important for the area so Brazilian Portuguese We did that about a year ago Working on local connect partnerships So we worked with larger companies like Terra but also any developer I mean you guys if you want can go sign up for Facebook Connect and build something The best integrations that we see don t come from these big companies They come from people in a dorm room just kind of hacking around and building something cool because you guys are willing to take more risks and do something that s a little crazier that might end up being more valuable So there s that part of it And then over time a lot of it is just you know people will get exposure to Facebook as they travel to different places and they meet friends who are on Facebook and then they ll come back and hopefully they ll ramp up over time Our philosophy on having offices in these local countries is that we don t want to do it until there are a large enough number of users that we could support kind of local sales and marketing So all of our development is done out of Palo Alto in California Some companies have different philosophy So I mean some companies for example want to put an office into a market that they want to grow in And we One of the downsides of that is if you don t end up growing in that market then you have to close down your office and lay off those people and we don t want to do that And we don t think that ad sales really drive user growth So what we ve done is we ve just focused on first building the product out so that it grows in the country then if it grows then we put an office there And we ve done this a bit in Europe we have UK office Paris office opening one up in Australia So I think if we keep on growing in Brazil at the rate that we re growing at now then it s completely conceivable 44 00 that in a year or so we ll have an office here  Male Hi I m a student at Colombia University currently working with the inaudible 44 09 here at Chevit 44 10 and my questions involved non profit involvement Seems that non profit organizations are using Facebook more to meet two goals one rally supporters and also fund raising I d like to know how you see Facebook improving to better address these two needs   So this is actually a really good example of where the Facebook platform for developers has worked really well So one of our leading applications is called Causes and what this group has done It s a startup out of Berkeley California and what they basically done is they built an application that allows people to spread which causes they care about to their friends share it with their friends I mean in order to raise awareness and raise money for different causes that they think are important And this is a really pretty good example I think of Facebook being able to develop the core social infrastructure and the ways that people can share information with friends but not having to develop every single example of ways that people want to share information So this company with a small number of people I think they re less than 20 people still has done a way better job of building an application for non profits than we would be able to do probably with that same number of people just because and we have a company that s focused on what we do right And their company is focused purely on this and they stayed a lot of focused and leveraged because of that Another example is games And there are companies that just are building really good games on top of Facebook and we just don t have the DNA in our company at this point to be building games but there are these whole companies that are just focused on building games and because of that they could do a good job So that said a lot of non profits are using Facebook pages directly So in addition to people signing up and creating a profile for themselves anyone can create a page for any entity they want 46 00 and people can become fans of those pages and then the people who are running those pages can use the pages can use the pages to share information with all the people who are fans of them So I think politicians or large brands like Coca Cola are some of the biggest pages on the site with millions and millions of fans But I think non profits do a lot of this as well So a lot of people want to get out the word out of what they re doing will sign up for pages and do it that way  Male Mark I have a question about I understand Facebook has very a strong analytics and knowledge is power so you know what people are liking you know what they re buying you know what they think about things Could you talk about how you use how you can make revenue from that and also the responsibility that that power brings   Well so we do know a lot about what people are sharing and doing but the important thing is that these are all things that people are doing themselves So one of the big questions now for how the web plays out is I was talking about this a bit before but it s around whether people end up having control over their own information right There s kind of the two models There s like the Facebook social network model which is you know you type in your name into Facebook you go to your profile Everything there you have control over right down from photos that are posted of you to your interests and basic info about you to the things that you ve liked The other model is kind of like the search model where you type in your name to a search engine and there s all these information about you but you have no control over it And then a lot of these advertising companies in the web now what they re trying to do is they re trying to learn about people but they re not trying to do it by getting people to share information directly what they re doing is they re kind of tracking you as you go around the web and putting a cookie in your browser and seeing what websites you go to and trying to infer from that what types of stuff you like And we don t do that What we do is we look at the information that you ve specifically put in to your profile 48 00 and we can target base of of that So you re only getting a Greenday ad if you ve said that you like Greenday or if you re associated with or if you like some other bands that are similar to Greenday or something like that So I think that there s a really big question for how the web plays out and whether it ends up with this model primarily where people have control over their information or if it ends up in this model where there s information that s available about people but people don t have control over it And just speaking to your question about responsibility with this we feel like our responsibility is to be a steward of people s data right I mean we hold a lot of information but fundamentally it s not our information it s people s information And we need to make sure that we at all times give control over that give them access to it in the ways that they want make it so that they can share in the ways that they want but also protect their privacy in the ways that they want and don t use it in the ways that they don t want So that s a just a really important balance that we strike but I m hopeful that if we do this correctly that we can move the web in this direction of people having more control over their information everywhere and can build a better model on all levels on user product developer product advertiser product than models that are based on of tracking users  Male Hi Mark A couple of days ago I got an email from Facebook saying that my mom had joined Facebook and added me as a friend which was both weird and scary   That s awesome Laughing  Male Yeah Maybe We ll found out But it also made me think what You know people over 30 40 50 they have tremendous purchasing power and that could translate to revenue for your company What if anything do you to encourage the older demographic to be active on Facebook   Well so in our efforts for spreading the site I mean there are few things that we found that we need to do for people to be able to use it So for example 50 00 be available in their language On top of that the main way that we spread the site isn t actually us doing anything at all It kind of is very in line with what our advertising philosophy is which is that people spread stuff to their friends much better than we could ever spread stuff directly So what we ve tried to do is build tools that make it so that people can get their friends engaged with Facebook and get them involved very easily So everything from being able to import their address book and be able to share Facebook with your friends that way to on the site recommending people who you ll probably know or like the people who may know and then making it so that you can just add people really easily who you might know on the site All those things just make it so that people can get their friends engaged in the site more easily And that s the primary way that we re spreading the site So I mean going back to your question about do we want specific demographics on the site I mean at this point we kind of feel like this is Like everyone wants to stay connected with their friends and family At different points in your life you may want to share different kinds of things or care more about staying connected with certain people than others But overall it s such a core human thing to need to stay connected with the people around you that we think that it s a really universal thing that people of all ages and all countries are going to end up using It s just I think it s pretty natural that younger folks who are spending more time on the internet would be the first people using this but overtime I think it makes sense as well that a lot of other folks are going to get on to  Augusto Hi Mark my name is Augusto I would like to know what Facebook means for you and for your life   So I m like the number one user I m 52 00 always on Facebook I mean I made the version because it was the service that I wanted to exist I mean even just the little community that I was a part of at the time You know for me the reason why this is exciting and the kind of guiding philosophy for the people that we found to hire around us at the company so now we have around a thousand people working at Facebook is are people who really care about building things and who care deeply about technology and who feel like the problems that we re solving of making the world more open but in a good way that people have control over their information In other word evolves in a way that s kind of safe for people People will feel like that s an important problem to be solving I mean one of the cool things about doing something that ends up being this successful is that you kinda get a lot of flexibility to work on whatever you want and the reason why I m really about working on this is because I really think that this is one of the bigger issues that people in our generation are going to be dealing with right Increased information transparency and increased information flow will change how we represent our identity and negotiate our reputation and privacy and all those things So building the services that give people the tools to do that in the way that they want I think will end up incredibly important So that s why I m really psyched about it A lot of what I spend my time doing now is actually pretty similar to where I was before I do a little less programming now I don t program for Facebook directly Every once in a while I ll fix a bug just cause I want to stay in touch with the code base But I ll program a little bit for fun on the side But I mean I really like making things So now Facebook is a really good vehicle where we can work on a lot of different things at the same time A thousand people is kind of a cool size for an organization because it s big enough to do some damage but not so big that you have no idea what s going on with all these people So we can have a good number of projects going on at a time and that s pretty fun 54 00 And it just kinda like a lot of smart people around me You know a lot of the people are the same people who are there when I was getting started with it at Harvard You know I mean there s a group of my roommates and people who kind of joined and came up to California with me originally and then some of the first set of people that I hired were my teachers at Harvard and people who I thought were really smart And then No because I dropped out and had two years left two years later a bunch of my friends who I used to do all my problems with like math and computer science and all that ended up joining as well I mean these are some of the people who are running the company now which is kind of cool It s like a company run by 25 year olds And it s a good time We all work hard and we all believe a lot on what we re doing  Male We have time for one last question who would like  Male Mark inaudible 54 53 to ask you why do think that Myspace inaudible 55 05   Yeah it s always hard to say So many things laughs You know I think one of the things that people confuse the most with these social sites is that they don t have the same purpose right So people used to compare Facebook and Myspace a lot back in the day and I actually I used to say all the time that I thought these sites were really different Facebook was all about staying connected with the real people that you cared about sharing information about yourself and Myspace was always more about kind of media connecting with these like larger personalities famous people bands things like that And I think kind of a similar thing is going on now with Twitter where I mean sometimes people compare Facebook and Twitter I actually think they are really different things I think Twitter is more similar to Myspace than anything so I think in a way 56 00 your question is very apt I think one of the things that Twitter has done really well that Myspace didn t do was they made it so that once you build up this like this network of people or this like or if you re a band and you have hundreds of thousands of people who like what you re doing there s no real outlet to continue communication with them And that s what Twitter has focused on and has done really well It s made it so that you can get followers you can communicate out with them It s a very different use case from what people are doing on Facebook and people don t really use Twitter quite as much to communicate with friends as much as they do to kind of get their opinion out different types of information are shared on the different services But yeah I think what they re doing is really good so and it s spreading really quickly around the world  Female Okay Professor Palisongras 56 50 is going to close the presentation but before I would like to ask you a favor please remain in your seats because Mark needs to leave urgently He has another appointment now and IMTV 57 02 is here and they are going to interview you and unless I think no no more And I would kindly ask you to leave the badges in the box in the

founder So thanks for thanks for coming I I heard rumor you were at CES but uh did you blew it off and come back for this   Yeah all for you any time  Speaker 1 Uh so you guys have won you guys have won the Best Overall Crunchies two two years in a row Every year there there s been a Crunchies you guys have won that I think it s been well deserved   Yup  Speaker 1  Inaudible 00 00 39 users growth and revenue real worth than anyone else Um but where do you take it from here And uh in particular I want to talk about Facebook Connect that s used to be unless you want to talk about different product You know that s it Where is it going and have you inaudible 00 00 55   Well we we don t think about it in terms of bad and we think about it in terms of you know people want to share uh a lot of stuff with their friends and you know people s friends and I would say a really really important part of that But yeah I mean so so we focused a lot of the last few years on um helping our users or in Facebook around the world right So we were after a 350 million users of uh if you look there s still quite a while to go with that but uh at this point we re really you know starting to focus a lot more on um on the platform and Connect right We we launched Facebook platform uh two and a half years ago now you know in in May of 2007 um and it s also see all the applications that are getting built more now   Um but you know we don t stop at uh the future for platform wasn t really just people building applications inside of Facebook You know that s a good way to start a good way and kinda help users to get used to using um information and their friends I with other applications that are built by us Um but the future is with Facebook Connect right cuz obviously much more is gonna be developed outside of Facebook and than inside Um and you know last year was the the first year that it 00 02 00 was widely available and um and it kind of great year you know tens of thousands of sites they are using Facebook Connect Um but there s still a lot more than we can do in in terms of decreasing inaudible 00 02 11 and making it easier to use making it easier for users to get started making it easier for developers to get started and integrate it in   And um that s gonna be a big focus for us this year goes on um you know larger applications making it so they can do deep integrations and um all the way down to you know people who just want to drop something to their site and haven t really used integration  Speaker 1 Okay Uh you ve always pushed the envelope on privacy I think you said in the past you things that surprised you that people wan t to disclose on privacy years ago You re surprised to see them willingly disclose it today Where where not just with Facebook but where is privacy in the web going over the next couple of years do you think   Well I mean it is an interesting bad right because I mean when I we we we didn t we don t start it just in my in my dorm room at Harvard Um you the the question a lot of people ask is Why would I want to put any information on the internet at all Like Why would I want to have a website Um and then you know in in the last five or six years you know blogging has taken off in a huge way in addition to all these different services that have people sharing more information Um and people have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds but more openly with more people and that social arm was just something that s mauled 00 03 19 over time   Um and we viewed as our role in in the in the system to constantly be kind of innovating and and um updating what our system is to reflect what the current social arms are so now a lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions and they re like CEO of the systems that they built um doing a privacy change for 350 million users  Speaker 1 Yeah    Is is a really you know it s it s crosstalk 00 03 43 that I know a lot of companies would do you know um but really I think that s just we view that as a really important thing to always kind of keep a beginner s mind and think you know what would we do if we were starting the a company now and starting the site now And um with the sudden abuse would be the social arms now and we we just went for it 00 04 00  Speaker 1 Uh from a corporate side and I don t know if you want to answer the questions but I ll ask Um are you gonna get more aggressive in our positions you ve made a few key ones to past Do you see do you see that happening in the next year Next two years   Well it s it s a good question So we acquisitions that we ve made that dbeen primarily to get create people to join the company We ve we ve done two oppositions One was the Parakey where um Blake Ross join the company has been really instrumental and building Facebook wide and um and helping spread Facebook around the world And Joe Hewitt joined build the Apple app from scratch um and spilled that out Um and then recently we we um bought FriendFeed and um Bret Taylor is one of the founders from FriendFeed who built um or founded and start Google Maps before um is is now you know running the the products on the platform now um called inaudible 00 04 45 is really involved in driving the um the engineering and culture at Facebook   And and the interesting thing is we really have around 300 engineers at Facebook Um so it s actually we ve tried to keep this ratio where there is you know more than about more than a million users through each engineer Um and you know that makes it so that What  Speaker 1 No just go ahead laughing   Oh laughs  Speaker 1 Um uh I think flew off with the same the same ratio we have in TechCrunch to be honest laughing So we have near or some more of them laughing   So we we we ve really start to built this this company that people can come and just have a huge thing 00 05 22 on the leverage and that s really what entrepreneurs want right They want to that s why they weave big companies and start new companies is just they want to put themselves in the opportunity um where they can have the big inaudible 00 05 31 And a lot of people are finding that you know from the next period of time Facebook is really great place to do that So as long as there are great people out there who want to join Facebook um we will find a way to make that happen  Speaker 1 Okay great Uh last question inaudible 00 05 45 Really Really   I don t have it in my pocket now laughing  Speaker 1 Thanks very much   Welcome '}\n",

where are we   Where at th the new Facebook headquarters um which w we call The Bunker It it s this little area and um right off the California Avenue in in down in in Palo Alto And um it s the first time that we have the whole company together in one place in about two and a half years so it s really cool You can walk around It s just complete open floor plan Everyone has a desk Lot of energy Really cool Very industrial We didn t we didn t spend a lot of money um making the place nice  Speaker 1 No it s you could be an HP uh lab or something like that right   Yeah and it s cool Th there s like th th the um the like vaults and things upstairs where you could just like where they used to store stuff in It s now someone s office Laughs Inaudible 00 00 56 room  Speaker 1 What I m what I m doing is getting around the world and uh meeting officers on things businesses and understanding how they re getting into what I call the 2010 web Some people call it the new web   Uh uh  Speaker 1 Other people call it Web 3 0 I don t know what to call it you know but um I m know there s a lot of businesses uh look like 1994 and I m trying to get them to see that there s something new happening What are you seeing happen and how can how are you seeing how small businesses can get into the new world   Well I think there are a lot of really interesting trends that are going on And one of the most important ones is just that there s more information that people are sharing now right So whether you re a person or you re running a small business or you re running a large business there s probably a lot more information out there about you Right And and a lot of that through tools like Facebook You can control that right So you get to say what information you wanna have on your profile um what photos you wanna share um through your business You can now have a voice through blogs and things like Twitter that you couldn t before And and things like Facebook obviously 00 02 00 And um it s just i it s a pretty exciting time  Speaker 1 Yeah Your dad was a dentist right   H he is a dentist  Speaker 1 He is a dentist So a lot of times when I m talking of small business people planes and stuff like that and I tell them you should use Facebook connection have people on your homepage They looked at me like I m sort of alien right   Hmm  Speaker 1 How do you how What advice will you give to somebody like your dad to get into this world   Well I think th the interesting thing about it is you know people have shared information for a long time But th the real thing that that makes up someone s identity is um the set of people who they re they re connected with right So um on Facebook I I know who you are because I know who the people who you are who you know and and which friends we have in common what things you like and all these different connections And um so you know when you have a website just having someone be able to come and log in um gives you some information about them and some contacts about who they are But few things like Facebook connect you can really understand who the person is and be able to tailor your product to it whether it s saying I m at at your dentist for for that takes some few or other people who you know who um has visited and maybe ask them what they think or here s what they think There s probably that information online somewhere So um so just some way of making it so that all the stuff is interconnected Just makes people trusting is more of it So for example you know t to use the the dentist thing again um if you could go to a dentist and you could see what your friend has thought of it then uh then then that would have obviously helped out if you re buying something on eBay or Craigslist To be able to go and and see Okay here s the person you re selling the item Um here s their track record of selling That s really valuable but also share it with people who I know who know them All right that s that have interconnection gives you a really clean sense of their identity and who they really are and allows you to build more trust with them  Speaker 1 Yeah I ve been telling people that you ve already built the white pages Right Everybody I know is on Facebook   Well 200 million are on  Speaker 1 200 million laughs Pretty much everybody I know Laughs I don t knowvery many people who are not on Facebook you know I mean to give you a story my wife my wife s friend who she grew up with in i00 04 00 Iran you know 30 years ago are all on Facebook I mean i it s a worldwide phenomenon If everybody who I touched is on Facebook And now you re it seems like Facebook is try is trying to turn to integrating businesses and that How are thinking Mark What s your philosophy of where Facebook is going to go with that in the future   Well if you think about this graph I mean the social graph is really the core of what we do And it s like our philosophy of the world and and how things are interconnected is really embedded in that So the idea is that um people don t exist in isolation You um are th the set of things that you re connected with Um it s you real identity and these are real connections that you have And part of that is that you know we re connected and and we re both people But another part of that is that I like Greenday for example or I go to my dad he s my dentist And um we ve really focused a lot on building out th the people inaudible 00 04 54 that Um and you know I think the user growth all over the world shows that And that that part has gone really well But I I think a big part of it now is just understanding what those other things are Right So you were both connected to this Greenday thing Wh what is that right Um f for someone else to want so see Um so that s why recently we ve been focused on pages and and public profiles and making it so that anyone whether it s politicians local businesses and people who want to have a voice for just all these different things can use that and and build all those on Facebook This ultimately just being able to map those things in one graph it s just gonna be really valuable for for understanding what all these people and things are and what they re doing  Speaker 1 Yeah one of the most exciting things is all the applications that this is our I I met a lot of businesses that are bit bit laughs building businesses based around Facebook and where do you think that s going to go in the future You know what are you going to do with the application platform   So um we re big believers in the platform concept which is basically that um you know th there are two ends of the spectrum One is that you know this is an system that exists of 00 06 00 thousands of applications maybe ten to thousands or or more right And that most of the value um could exist um outside of o of one application but exist in the wrong tail of all these applications On the other end of the spectrum is where I think a lot of inaudible 00 06 13 until now which is that most of the values in one website you know whether it s like Facebook or MySpace or wh whatever Any individual site I think what we re trying to do is move from this one website model to a model that enable um just all these different applications whether they re websites or desktop applications or mobile applications to um really cleanly integrate people s identity is in in the graph through Facebook um in in order to just be be able to be more useful in all these different ways So we re big believers in the idea that over time the value will be centralized from just being on Facebook to being um just spread out or a across the ecosystem And u ultimately I think that s a really good thing I mean it s I mean it s good for the web to be able to have all that functionality built into all these different applications And I think th the heart the place that Facebook will hold in the ecosystem will move more a away from being a website and more towards being this platform and this representation of the graph  Speaker 1 That that s really cool because it s what we re betting building for inaudible 00 07 12 One last question um a lot of people is Google started with Wave which looks like a a new thing   It looks cool  Speaker 1 It looks very cool   Yeah  Speaker 1 And Twitter s out there How do you see the competitive landscape taking shape and where do you think you re gonna um do something really interesting Wh why do you think people going to join   There s there s a lot of people who are doing really interesting things right now I think Google continually does interesting stuff and there are new companies like um Twitter and Frenzy that I think are doing really interesting stuff You know ultimately I think um one of the things that a lot of these companies talk about is that the web and and really the whole world are getting more open Right So that means there s there s more information available There s more that you can learn about more that you can understand Um and I think that s a trend that we all accept to play out for a long time and then much more 00 08 00 in the next five years Maybe the next 20 years that will be one of the most important trends in the world And I mean you can see what s happening in the next five years just in terms of everyone getting more mobile phones that have um small powerful applications and and interconnectivity But um there s a real question of how that happens Right And what the world looks like when it s open And um you know people talk about on the one hand um futures where that they are more dystopian or or where like people don t have control over their information Or like where um th the applications that exist are really kind of watching people and um that s like On Facebook we really don t want that to happen W w we care about making it so that people are sharing information people are ha have control over the information of that they re sharing have control over their identity Um and basically that the world is becoming more open but on people s terms right That s why privacy has always been a really important focus for us because we want to make it so that um we really believe that um if you give people the right tools and you give people permission um and and control over who they want to share it with then over time they will share more information just because i it creates value for them to be able to build out their identity and communicate with all these different people Um so I think that s the most interesting thing that s going on right now is there s there s a tension um between Austin and some other companies on on on both sides And um what we really want to see happen is should there be a web and a world where the world becomes more open and people can understand more of what s going on and people sharing more information but on the wrong terms They have control over it  Speaker 1 Very cool Thank you so much '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2010-007', 'content': ' Magid  0 03 Hi I m Larry Magid of ConnectSafely org Pause On May 26th 2010 emphasis Facebook announced some sweeping changes and most people would say improvements inhales pause to its privacy policy That move followed several weeks of controversy after Facebook had earlier done some things with its privacy policies quick pause that a lot of people didn t like Pause On the day they announced the privacy improvements inhale I sat down with  and I began the interview asking how he felt about everything he emphasis had been through during the past few weeks Announcer professional voice    0 36 Well pause you know it has definitely been an intense couple weeks Pause You know we we rolled out some products um at at our development conference f8 around a month ago And since then we ve really have just been listening to the feedback short pause t that everyone has had on on the different products that we ve rolled out And pause a lot of it has been really constructive and the main thing that we heard was just that short pause people want simpler controls longer pause over how they share information on Facebook so inhales pause we took the last couple of weeks to really build that out and to make sure it worked well And today we rolled that out Pause So longer pause it s an exciting time for us because we re responding to to all the feedback that we are getting and we re listening really carefully pause um but it s also been an intense period as well  Magid  1 12 I I remember when Facebook was the coolest emphasis thing in the planet You you you people were jealous emphasis because they pause didn t go to the right college and they couldn t get on And pause overtime pause you guys have grown up Obviously you must be cool because you ve got nearly a half 1 2 a billion people using the service inhales pause but there is a movement uh I guess on Monday there s a Quit Facebook Day there are critics uh I m just curious how does it feel to have started something that pause has gotten so much criticism by by people    1 36 Well our goal pause was never to build something cool short pause it was to build something that a lot of people found useful And pause now with almost you know we have more than four hundred 400 million people using our services I think you re bound to have pause a whole spectrum Right some people will love the services pause some people will use them but don t feel that passionately and pause swallow and then there are going to be some people who are going to be critical of what we do inhales deeply but I mean our focus is really to just pause to to help people share information And you know people pause really want to stay connected with their friends and family and the community around them and that s that s a core human need And pause um short quick pause we just think that we can build products that can help people to do that and that s what we try to do  Magid  2 11 I do have to ask you though about the the Quit Facebook Day and the Diaspora Project and the fact that there are really people slight pause who pause are pause concerned about it and we haven t heard from them today I don t know if their pause concerns are are lower now but I I just curious about what your reaction is to that And pause especially with what s going to happen on Monday    2 27 Well you know I mean we ve been we we listen to our users pause um pause we listen to a few things you know we listen to what they write the e mails that they send us the blogposts they write we also very slight pause listen to pause the stats right and and the data of of about what people are doing and we ve found that pause the same number of people are promoting Facebook to their friends and encouraging them to sign up pause now short pause as were before all of this and quick pause the same number of people are sharing pause the same number of things as they were before And and some people have talked about deactivating but those numbers haven t changed either So pause I think some people may have been talking about this stuff but short pause when it comes down to it I think people still feel pause like they can rely on Facebook as the best place for them to share and stay connected with the people they pause that they care about And I think that the changes that we announced today making it even simpler to control your information just make that even better So pause yeah I think some people are going to be critical and are going to have feedback and we want to listen to all of that feedback but overall it doesn t seem like anything like a like a big movement or anything like that  Magid  3 25 There s a cynical reaction that by definition in order for Facebook to grow and make the kind of money to value the company of the multi billion dollar company that it needs emphasis to do more than just put up display ads and it needs emphasis some kind of monetization or data mining and I I I m wondering kinda your response to that Can you build a business and and make a profit and do all the things that you need to do financially pause and not emphasis do things that get at people angry and pause worry them    3 50 I mean I think the answer is is clearly yes I mean one of things that we ve done we ve focused on pause keeping the advertising on the site pause very short pause kind of minimal and sparse Right And really only good relative stuff to you We read a lot pause less emphasis pause ads than pause a lot of other sites do It d be a much easier to just have a huge number of ads on the page and we don t And the reason why we don t have to is because the ads work well right and we are making enough money to support ourselves and to keep on building great services And over the long term pause we can do the best thing that we can do is build products that can help people share and stay connected with the people that they care about If we do that then people will use our products and short pause if they use our products then pause we make money from advertising Um pause so the model all works out Now I mean there are all these misperceptions about how this site works Right so an and a few of them are really um are really bad right and that I would want to clear out right now So inhales there s been this one pause um rumor that has been going around that has been completely not true which is pause that pause we give information to advertisers and we don t We don t give any information slight pause to advertisers that s not the way the site works Um we don t sell any information we never will Um that s not a a plan or or anything that we re that we ve even thought about doing Um the site works by pause you know we help you share information when we do that you re more engaged on the site um pause and then there are ads on the side of the page so the more you are sharing the more the the model just all works out you know  Magid  5 10 You ve been around the block on privacy You ve had to be constitution you ve had a number of situations even in December when you thought you were increasing privacy some people complained Deep breath pause Ah ah are you a little worried about a sort of privacy policy change fatigue and pause you know this this is sort of the upteenth time Facebook has changed its privacy policies    5 27 Well pause privacy is a very sensitive issue that a lot of people care about So yeah we have to be careful about it and that s why one of the things that I m actually most excited about that we talked about today is you know we ve been working on this um this pause on this these set of changes on our privacy system for the last six 6 months but now we re done Pause Right so we re actually not going to make uh we re not going to make changes for a long time and um pause you know one of the the things that we talked about today this simple control it applies to not only the stuff you ve pause um shared in the past pause but to new products and services that we ve launched going forward So I think we ve designed these products now so that people don t have to think about the stuff as much going forward They just set the level of privacy that they want to have Pause And then that ll exist for a long time pause and quick pause no more changes  Magid  6 10 Uh you famously made a comment once which I think has been interpreted a lot about I can t remember whether with privacy can t get over it I don t think that was your quote but deep inhale there was this notion you know you re what twenty six 26 years old you re of a generation that pause may have a different attitude about privacy than older folks And small inhale I m just sorta curious sort of what you re sense is emphasis going forward inhales pause maybe even take your Facebook hat off just put on twenty six 26 year old Mark what is your sense of what it means to have privacy in the twenty first 21st century    6 36 Well pause you know I think people will always care about privacy pause and short pause they ll care even more about having control about how they share stuff Right so for example inhales you know I just went on this vacation with my family a little while back and slight pause I wanted to share the photos from that with my pause with my with my family but not with everyone Right If my only option was to share it with everyone then I wouldn t pause have shared them at all Right Inhales deeply Um Long pause So pause because I was able to share the the photos with exactly the set of people I wanted in this case you know just my my sisters and my parents inhales I was able to do that Pause And longer pause you know that s that s I think really important to people People care about privacy they care about control Deep breath pause With the internet and people sharing more information I do think that how people are thinking about this is shifting a bit just because they want to share more information with the people that they care about inhales And you know sometimes when I talk about this people short pause people take what I say out of context a bit inhale slight pause and they take what I m what I m saying as as if you know privacy isn t going to be important or I pause think it s not going to be around forever and that s just not true I think privacy is a fundamentally emphasis important thing that s always going to be around  Magid  7 37 You don t have to be as smart as  to know that when something that s digital pause no matter who sees it it can be copied cashed forward destored I mean do you have any advice to people about privacy regardless of your settings just very short pause what you should and shouldn t post on Facebook or anywhere else    7 51 Yeah I mean I think one thing to think about is pause in the offline world if you tell a friend about something pause even if they pause spread it to other people pause it s still there s all this friction in the world about short pause how stuff pause spreads right from person to person and it takes a long time there s a lot of friction in that Inhales Online there isn t as much friction Right I I mean if you share something people can share that with other people very quickly So I just think that it s really important that when when people are pause are um sharing things online that they re they re thinking about that That they actual share things with the set people that actually want to Right so Inhales I want that photo album to go to my family only I I didn t share it with everyone I just shared it with my family Inhales I want to send a message to my friend or someone who I work with I just send that message to them I don t send it to everyone But as long as you re thinking about this stuff which I think most of us do all the time Pause I think it ends up being a very useful service  Magid  8 37 Uh prior to coming over here I posted some questions to some educator friends I asked them what should I ask  and pause one of the comments that somebody made is that Look pause Facebook doesn t allow people under thirteen 13 but the reality is that they get on And there s a question about have you ever thought about sort of a Facebook Junior or some way of actually welcoming emphasis pause under thirteen 13 year olds you know compta compliant of course pause and building a safe short pause environment where they quick pause could really participate    9 01 I mean pause it s something that we ve talked about pause a little bit but pause the restrictions and regulations around it are make it very difficult So it s just never been pause the the top of the list in terms of things we want to do Inhales One of the big priorities for us right it is to just swallows you know spreading the site and making it so that short pause people in all countries around the world can can use it to connect And now with you know with more than four hundred 400 million people on the service inhales a lot of people in a lot of different countries use Facebook but short pause there s still some countries that that Facebook isn t that big in yet And we re more focused on spreading it to those countries right now So this year for example we are focusing a lot on Japan and Russia  Magid  9 36 Probably through no fault of your own a lot of schools block Facebook and all social networking sites yet long pause there s a lot of really great educational resources of Facebook inhales and I m wondering if you have given any thought to sorta how you expand your reach into education and get people to realize that pause can be used productively    9 52 Well I think it just I think it gets back to what you re saying There s a lot of valuable information out there That s the whole mission of the company to make the world more open and connected to make it so that short pause you know if you pause have more awareness and can access more information then that s good and if you have more empathy for the people around you then that s good as well Inhales So pause it plays you know uh uh it could potentially play a really important role in education Just helping people get access to to more information Pause And pause you know as the service evolves pause I I m a believer that pause when things are valuable people eventually realize that So I think that if we can help out in education then the folks who are blocking us today will come around to that and will encourage their students to use the service in the future  Magid  10 30 And now that you ve had a a little bit of a bad couple of weeks behind you what are you looking forward to    10 34 Building pause good products That s what we do  Magid  10 37 Can you be more specific as to what that means I know you re not going to tell me company secrets but inhales pause give me a sense of sort of where we re going with this    10 43 I don t know there s a lot of good stuff that we re working on that that we ll roll out in the next small exhale you know few months But I mean one of the things that I am pause personally excited about pause there are a bunch of product that we are building on Facebook com but I m also really excited just about working with other other websites and and game developers to make their applications more social so that you can interact with your friends inhales in all the different places you go And pause I don t know I just think that the more things that we do where we can stay connected with our friends the better the world gets So pause I m really excited about that stuff Magid  11 13 I hadn t planned to ask you this but I uh for some reason I want to Do you have any role models people who you look up to    11 19 Uh yeah A bunch um pause some of them are are involved in the company and on our board I mean Don Graham was you know a a role model for a long time and that I I and he he joined our board Um pause I really look up to his long term approach to running pause uh the Washington Post company  Magid  11 34 And and what about some people who have sort of been ahead of you Uh Pause Bill Gates he had his problems adjustive department Google is having its problems right now in terms of privacy pause and uh and some federal trade commission issues and uh I is this sign of a club that you re part of now of people who have built big organizations that are pause on the hot seat    11 52 Nah It doesn t feel like a club Laughing Um No I mean there s a lot of people who have done who have done really cool stuff  Magid  11 59 Well  CEO of uh Facebook thank you very much for taking the time    12 02 Yeah Thank you '}\n"

      "{'filename': '2010-008', 'content': ' Article You might expect that Facebook founder and CEO  would dismiss the four NYU college students who want to take on Facebook s dominance of social networking by building a distributed open alternative that includes a way for people to run their own servers But instead Zuckerberg said he donated to the Diaspora project adding to the 190 000 it has raised in part because he appreciates their drive to change the world Note This reporter followed up with Facebook s press office Thursday to ask how much Zuckerberg donated to Diaspora but the press office said they d rather not answer In an interview with Wired com on Wednesday after announcing simpler privacy controls for Facebook Zuckerberg also talked about where he sees the site going his drive to make the world more open why the face in Facebook is so important and why he wouldn t start a social network if he were launching a site today  Wired com What do you think of the push for an open federated social network and the four NYU students who raised 200 000 for the Diaspora project without having a single line of code   I donated I think it is a cool idea Actually it reminds me of this cool thing we built early on called Wirehog Early on it was clear that users wanted more photos on the site There were a set of users who would change their one profile picture every day And we looked at that data and took that as people want to share more photos I see a little of myself in them But photos are expensive and we didn t have an infrastructure We were just trying to grow the site and add more colleges to the site So we built this personal web server that people could install on their computer where they could put all their files on it which at the time were mostly photos but it supported videos and music and share it with your friends So in a way it was the prototypical platform app but it was also a decentralized way to share information So I think it is a cool idea just based on that I think it is cool people are trying to do it I see a little of myself in them It s just their approach that the world could be better and saying We should try to do it  Article  Editor s note Wirehog was killed off by Facebook after Facebook s then president Sean Parker who co founded Napster argued that Wirehog would face the same ugly legal death that the infamous peer to peer music sharing site did On Wednesday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference Parker called it illegal and said he put a bullet in it   In an interesting way a lot of the privacy stuff is much easier to do in a centralized environment Some of the simple stuff like friend to friend peer to peer stuff is simple but once you start getting into friends of friends you start running into problems like we did with Wirehog If someone can come up with a new approach then that s awesome It bums me out that people immediately go to You must be doing this to make money  Wired com If you were building a Facebook competitor from scratch now is that the way you would go   The thing I really care about is the mission making the world open A lot of times I run a thought experiment If I were not at Facebook what would I be doing to make the world more open Because I think when I got started six years ago building a social network was the best thing to do Now today I m not sure that s the best thing to do Now we exist and there is a big opportunity to build atop the platform There are all these awesome new technologies that didn t exist back then like EC2 and S3 Editor s note He s referring to on demand cloud storage and computing services from Amazon And if I were starting over those would be awesome It s a good thought experiment to do because if we as a company are not doing those things now that are the most important things to make the world more open three to five years from now then we should be doing them I would guess areas around mobile are more cutting edge right now  Wired com How much do you think the backlash over the last few weeks is related to the size of Facebook and it starting to feel like a company on the scale of Google where people can t always pinpoint what it is they are really annoyed about   I don t know it is hard to say There certainly are a lot more communities that we serve now I think the feedback people had was really reasonable The privacy controls were complex We should make them simple So I don t know one thing that is personally a bit disheartening It bums me out that people immediately go to You must be doing this to make money Because that s just so different from the ethos of the company It is so different from how we actually think about stuff that you feel so misunderstood  Wired com Is that because there are things you could do to make a lot more money right now   Yeah I guess we could There are really simple things we could do For one thing we keep advertising pretty sparse If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads They may be relevant ads since they are related to your search But clearly taking up a lot more space with more ads would make us more money That s the simplest thing we could do But we aren t like that We make enough money Right I mean we are keeping things running we are growing at the rate we want to Humans are just hard wired to process people s faces  Wired com What is your vision for what you want Facebook to become for the internet   I think that there is something that is just fundamental about using products that are centered around people as opposed to centered around information that is not about people We see it in all of the user tests we do We run all these eye tracking tests and we see that when people look at the homepage of Facebook they don t look at any of the navigation links They look at people s faces and they navigate by clicking on people s faces I think humans are just hard wired to process people s faces and understand meaning and expression at such a more granular level than other types of communication So I think there is something about that that will find its way into all applications whether it all websites or all mobile applications And I don t think we will do all of that but I hope that we can help make that happen  Wired com Is Instant Personalization something that you d really like to expand upon Is that why it is opt in rather than opt out Editor s note Instant Personalization is the new program where Facebook is sending Facebook user information to sites like Yelp and Pandora when a logged in Facebook user visits a site Facebook opted all its users into the system and because of a user backlash has made it easier for users to opt out   Well we have a version of Instant Personalization that is opt in it is just Connect Editor s note This is the system that lets you log into another website using your Facebook credentials and share your profile information with that site And that s what most people most of the developers use We believe that these experiences can be personalized right as you start them and that is really powerful So we took two approaches we have social plug ins there are 100 000 sites that have social plug ins The idea is we create these simple plug ins so that a publisher with one line of code can insert social functionality into their site It s a really engaging experience and there are really no privacy concerns around it since we are not sharing information with that site so you don t have to worry about your data So that s something we think we can roll out very broadly Instant Personalization is more of a pilot project asking What can a company do if they can really customize things themselves If we owned Pandora for example which we are not trying to then I don t think anyone would have a hard time with us building a customized experience because we are part of the same company What we said is Let s try working really closely with them and get our product and engineering teams close together and our lawyers work together to write a really clear contract and a privacy policy as if we were part of one organization Over the long term more applications will get more social and it s a big part of what we want to do Instant personalization is a cool thing but it s a small part of what we are doing I don t think the world is going to evolve in a way that there is just one big site  Wired You are moving from being a place where people share photos and keep up with friends to a site where people define themselves online Is that where you see the company going   We don t think about it in those terms exactly When people think about identity in the past they think about building out all this profile information I understand why people think that about us but our view is the world is more interconnected Really who you are is defined by the people who you know not even the people that you know but the people you spend time with and the people that you love and the people that you work with I guess we show your friends in your profile but that s kind of different from the information you put in your profile So in a way we are capturing and mapping what s most important to you and that s a big part of why we can build these services ourselves and build this platform that lets other people build really great services But by far the most important thing about people is who they care about  Wired com Do you think there is a danger in Facebook getting too big   I think that one thing that would be bad is if we tried to do everything ourselves I don t think any one company can That s why we have this strategy about building this platform That is just going to be the most effective way to effect the change we are hoping to make We just couldn t build all this stuff even though we have all these really smart people No one is that good I don t think the world is going to evolve in a way that there is just one big site I think it is going to be that there are going to be a lot of really great services and we are helping to get it there I think people are always a little skeptical when something grows to something big but I think you need to look at what it is doing I think people have good questions about what we are doing but I think they should ask the same questions about other types of models as well We have a model based on control You put everything in your profile or your friends do but you get ultimate control over whether it stays there It s very different from a model like web search where you can look yourself up and you have no control over what is there The way our ads work we will show you ads we think are relevant based on what you have told us but a lot of other ad networks will show you ads based on tracking you around the internet and seeing what you look at So I think the feedback people give us is usually fair if it is based on the right facts We just think we are part of this important trend and we want to push it as far as we can but I also think it is important to look at the whole ecosystem  Wired com What about turning profile links into links to Facebook interest pages When someone likes Wired com they don t really mean they like the Facebook page representation of Wired com they like Wired com   This is the whole open graph you can put a Like plug in on Wired com and you actually like Wired com Editor s note We have that plug in It makes these pages outside of Facebook part of the Open Graph This is interesting We were talking about decentralization early This is us trying to push it in that direction to the extent it makes sense For example my favorite band is GreenDay and they have a page on Facebook but they also have their own site GreenDay com So why should someone have to fan a page on Facebook We want to make it so that when you connect to it it shows up in your graph it shows up in your music and if someone clicks on it it goes to GreenDay com and if you are connected to it you can get updates in the stream from it So that is a lot of the stuff we launched at f8 So if I search for Green Day I get the items that are most connected and if that Green Day happens to be GreenDay com I will link to GreenDay com It gets really interesting with sites like Yelp and CitySearch Again we feel like we will be better off if we don t try to do everything Yelp is a much better service at that than we are We are happy to link to them If a person wants to find the best Mexican restaurant and they want to see what their friends like the page they link to doesn t have to be on Facebook '}\n"

10  Walt I just was telling him that  Kara Yeah  Walt He s he s he came here He s eager to talk about uh where Facebook is going Uh both the controversies and issues they ve been going through on  Kara And where crosstalk 00 00 22  Walt privacy and also where social networking is going So without further ado  Kara So without further ado   Music  Walt Thanks man  Kara So so what would you like to begin  Walt Um well why don t we do it this way we do want to get to the talking about the future but we have some there is some controversy you ve just been through So let me just start by asking you um you have a business that s based on sharing Obviously people go on Facebook unless they wanted to share with groups of people but there is this perception that uh you re on a course or have been on a course to push people s information into a position where it s pretty much visible across the internet unless they do a bunch of stuff about it Is that a wrong perception and been wrongly 00 01 23 labeled with that or is that something that you didn t communicate right or what is your feeling about that   Sure Privacy is a really important issue for us and for the internet So we spent a lot of time thinking about these things In terms of the settings that we have I think that there are some misperceptions and then some of it I think is in line with what we re trying to do So you know the primary things that people do on the service like you are saying are they use it to share with their friends and the people around them in their community and they use it to stay connected right with and to kind of keep in touch with people and you know there are different parts of the service that people use for both 00 02 00 right So a lot of the time when I talk about sharing What I m talking about is you know people will um push the status update sometimes I ll do that and make it available to everyone at Facebook everyone at the company You know sometimes you ll share photos or you might go on vacation and take photos with your family and only want to share that with your family right you have the control to be able to do that So that s kind of on the sharing side That s most of what people are doing on a day to day basis Then there s the side of uh staying connected with people where you know you don t start off on Facebook with all of your real life friends already being your friends So people need to be able to search for you type in your name um figure out which person you are right I mean we probably have pretty unique names but you know our head of products his name is Chris Cox So there s a million Chris Coxes Um so when looking for him needs to be able to know okay here s we share these friends he works on Facebook he s from this place Um and having some information be visible more broadly is very valuable for that So what we found overtime is that there are really good settings for people to have to enable people to stay connected with them and find them and there are good kind of default ways that people want to be sharing information with the community around them and that s kind of what we re trying to do Now I mean there have been misperceptions that say that we re trying to make all the information open or something like that and that s completely false I mean there are big buckets of information that we recommend that you share with only your friends privately All the really sensitive stuff like your contact information your address your phone number who can go and post stuff on your page That stuff is all set to friends only Um more sensitive stuff like um like photos of you or videos of you we recommend that that s only visible to your friends of friends like people in the community around you and then some of the more basic information we recommend that that s visible to everyone  Kara Okay now when you did that though this was this is a complaint I hear from a lot of people not to inaudible 00 03 48 people is they come to Facebook with the beginnings of these are people I know that I m linking with and I m not sharing with people I don t know and I will pick who I know and I don t know Some of these things were changed because you recommend them 00 04 00 Perhaps we don t agree with your recommendations Why did you go to that at that one point Did you expect that kind of backlash or did you feel like it s a blogosphere backlash It s just annoying people like myself Um would you feel like it s an actual genuine backlash that people were expecting one thing and then you recommended something that made it so before they had a chance to participate in it which was Steve was talking about last night You tell them again you tell them again and then you tell them again in plain English   Sure I mean I think the most important thing is we recommended settings for people and that we always do whether it s when they sign up or you know along the way when we launch new things W we recommended settings for people and we ask that everyone go and review their settings and make a choice for what they want their settings to be You know so that all of that process and we didn t change any settings or anything like that I think that that s a really important piece of this Um you know the big feedback that we got that I actually it really resonated with me um was that overtime the privacy settings have just become too complex right We built privacy into every single product that we ve ever launched during the from the beginning of the site each piece of information that you shared um had a privacy setting It s not only whether it s public or private It s you can set it to be open to everyone You could set it to be open to the communities around You could set it to be open to just your friends or even a smaller group than that and over years of just launching product and product and product we accumulated dozens of settings So it really resonated to me at least when people are saying you know what we want to make sure is that we have control over how we re sharing information Um but with all these settings we re not sure how to use them So that s what we did we kind of we spent a couple of weeks building this We built one main setting that people can now use um so that it controls all of the information they re sharing on a day to day basis and you could just set it all to be open to everyone or friends or whoever you want  Kara Right we re talking about 00 05 49  Walt But there s a difference between sort of your user interface for your settings which you have overhauled and so it s good to be simpler and I know that you can still go on and customize them and have them more 00 06 00 complex for you if you want and that s all good but real issue is whether people trust that you re still onboard with the idea that they thought you are onboard with when they join I think this is what Kara was saying which is it s a place to share with people a limited group of people not an unlimited group of people and certainly not the whole internet and you did this in personalization thing You did these community pages Is that what they were called These things just came at members of Facebook you know you go on to Facebook one day and there s an announcement from you guys that oh you know what you know those interest you put on your page three years ago when you joined now they re all linked to some pages and you re like what what does that mean Who has access to those pages What are those pages Now if you ve done some abrupt things that yes there was a way to back out of them by going to privacy settings but even if they were simpler privacy settings you re still putting the owners on me to do some work to maintain the level of privacy I expected at the beginning So the question that I have is not about whether your privacy settings where complicated or simple or better or worst but why do I have to do the work to even go to them Why are you taking preemptive steps that make me go and check and make sure that I have the control I want   Sure Well I think that how the system is set up is a really important part for how it functions and before I was talking about how there is two primary things that people do They share information with the people around them It s never been by default just for friends It s always been kind of community around you whether it was colleges or companies or regions most recently Um you know and then the other thing is people want to stay connected with the people around them and you know I mean there s this thing that we re seeing more and more There s serendipity in how people are sharing information on these services Um that can only happen when you re sharing it with when you re sharing things with a broader group of people So let me give you an example 00 08 00  Walt Yeah   Um you know pretty recently I ve been trying to schedule um a dinner just to hang out with our head of technical operations Jonathan Heiliger for weeks and we just we haven t been able to set it up just because we re both busy on different evenings and one night I found you know my dinner plans got canceled and I posted something online I was like okay I m going to this place uh status This uh go to people in my community around me Um and he actually in a reply and he said okay I m there So I ended up going and we ended up getting dinner and it was pretty kind of i it was this great kind of serendipitous moment That happens through sharing The type of thing that I think the type of connection that gets made on Facebook  Walt I m a little confused You wanted to have dinner with one single person  Kara Well no I I didn t expect that he was going to be there Um so what I m saying is  Walt Because you could have e mailed him right or you could have texted him or something   Maybe I m not doing a great job telling the story I was trying to get dinner with him for a while I did not expect that he was gonna be here  Walt I see okay  Kara So you re saying that the idea which crosstalk 00 08 56   So yeah so I was going to a place and I ended up running into a friend there right and you know not that we call that serendipity right It s kind of a lucky coincidence when something like this happens and I I think one of the reasons why we consider this to be a lucky coincidence is because we miss most of the connections like that that are happening in the world around us But if  Walt But you did answer my question My question is you seem to have take some steps to make more public my information as a Facebook member on your own by yourself all of a sudden announcing them and without in my mind I m thinking well what I really have is I have X number of friends here I m happy to have them see my photos or my status messages I m happy to know when their birthdays are happy to have them write on my wall Why is the management of this company saying they re going to take some of my information and do some things with it  Kara I think what he means is there s different levels of what sharing means to you something different than what it means to Walt obviously You are thrilled that people know you re somewhere and they show up or something that is there a level 00 10 00 of privacy that just has to apply to everyone or do you think I mean you might have a view of this is what s privacy means to  So this is what it s going to mean at Facebook   Yeah I mean people can control this by themselves I mean simple control has always been one of the important parts of using Facebook and people one of the interesting fact that I think a lot of people don t know is that more than 50 of Facebook users um have changed the privacy settings at some point in their experience right So most of users go through their settings and will tweak at least one thing Now I think that that s interesting because it shows that A people understand what the settings are or people are using them right So we go through and we recommend what we think are the right settings for people um and then they use the product if they want They can change it if they want People are but then also the majority of the people who are going through this um aren t changing most of the settings right So th they re going through and they re seeing the settings and changing what they want but also kind of keeping the things that they want to have  Kara Right   So to me that s a signal that we re on a whole getting it right but also doing a reasonable job of giving people control so that way it can go on and change the things that they want as well  Kara So do you feel like it s a backlash or do you feel like you re violating people s privacy when you re inaudible 00 11 12 because some things do for better or worse whether you deserve it or not some of these you know you re a public figure you get a lot of things Those e mails back in college they stick to you now whether you like it or not and it s probably unfair to I don t want to see texts that I wrote when I was 19 years old or maybe last week even Um  Walt  laughs  Kara Truly um why does that do you feel like it s fixed to you or why does it because you happen to run a service that is sharing How do you explain the hubbub around it How what do you and it must affect you as a person because   Yeah you know I mean when I was 18 or 19 years old I did a lot of stupid things right when I was in college and I think um you know I don t want to make an excuse for that right I did stupid things I think they re embarrassing and um 00 12 00 I m really sorry that I did them Um you know some of the things that people accuse me of are true some of them aren t I think a lot of them has been pretty well documented  Kara Right   Um you know the case Max Franks 00 12 09  Kara Would you like to say which ones are true   Um you know I mean I think there s there s I actually don t even know looking back you know like oh I am so printed 00 12 16 it s tough for me to tell  Kara Right   But I mean there s face mash right and there are some IM s that have been printed There s pranks there s blogs Um you know it s  Kara I think the issue is you became the head of the biggest social networking company on the planet   Yeah I know but I  Kara  crosstalk 00 12 32 so everything you said doesn t matter   I think the interesting thing is that you know so I started this when I was you know I started working on this type of stuff when I was 18 I started building this when I was around 19 years old Um and along the way just you know we I just came to I think you know a lot of stuff changes We ve gone from building this project in a dorm room to now having a service that almost 500 million people  Kara Right crosstalk 00 12 52   are using um on a day to day basis and um  Kara It s that 00 12 57 They want to know who you are and what you actually think I mean you should and you should explain to them I mean in some way do you feel like you re adequately portrayed as a because they want to wonder about the person who actually created this thing   Yeah I mean uh a lot of stuff happened along the way I think um you know there are real learning points and turning points along the way in terms of um in terms of building things You know it really went from this position very early on where we re just in this college dorm room to we moved out to California There was a few friends and me and um you know I just kind of had this project feel 00 13 36 for a while and there was this real turning point when um when companies started trying to buy the company for a huge amount of money and you know I tell you I kind of get my friends together and we had to decide what was it that we really cared about and what was it that we wanted to do um and we decided not to take those offers and  Kara Right   to me a lot of that decision was that what we wanted to do and what we wanted to spend you know a big part of our lives 00 14 00 doing was just continuing to push and um and kind of build products that help people share information um build products that help people stay connected and that s really what we re spending our time doing and you know I think there s just been a lot of space between that early stuff and where we are now um if I knew what I knew now then then I hope I wouldn t have made those mistakes but I can t go back and change the past I can only do what we think is the right thing going forward  Walt So the poem about 00 14 30 this privacy thing and I thought that was a fascinating answer  Kara That s okay You want to take off the hoodie   No I never take off the hoodie  Walt  laughing  Kara I know you don t What s up with that There s a group of women in the audience that wish you would   No Laughing  Kara Girls   Whoa Laughing  Walt All right  Kara Right That s okay  Walt Um can you explain what this instant personalization thing was that you did and why you did it and what was the what s the value of it to your users   I guess I should take off the hoodie  Kara Take off the hoodie  Walt Go ahead what the hell  Kara Do you want to Are you hot Laughs  Applause  Kara Here let me get someone   Ah  Kara You re all right   Yeah  Kara This is a great moment in internet history  Laughing   What Ah Um what am I going to do with the mike  Kara Put it on your  Walt Put it on the collar of our t shirt Do you want something to inaudible 00 15 20  Kara Do you need some help   No I m good  Kara All right okay  Walt Sorry about this  Kara I hope I m not being inaudible 00 15 26 Mark   No it s  Kara We re not even yelling at you   Yeah  Kara Yet  Walt We re not gonna yell  Kara No of course not   Ah  Kara That is a warm hoodie What crosstalk 00 15 35   Yeah no it s a thick hoodie We it s um it s a company hoodie We print our mission on the inside  Kara What  Walt Oh really  Kara Oh my god the inside of the hoodie everybody  Laughing   Ah  Kara What is it Making the   Making the world more open and connected  Kara Oh my god It s like a secret cult  Walt Oh  Laughing  Kara Look at that making the world open and connected applause stream graph platform and this weird symbol in the 00 16 00 middle that is probably for the Illuminati  Laughing  Kara Oh 2010  Walt No it s 2010  Kara Okay Oh no I read inaudible 00 16 10 on it  Walt So what s the what is instant personalization and why did you do it What s it about   Sure it s something 00 16 14 So what we re trying to do is um you know we re building Facebook in this way that we think is pretty different from most other sites It s a lot more engaging than than you know most every other website out there and we think that the reason for that is that it s designed to round people fundamentally Um you know when you look at the newsfeed um we ve done this interesting I tracking studies where you know to see how people use the site and unlike most applications people don t browse to looking at navigation They browse through looking at people right It s like you kind of fix it on a person s face and um and you navigate through that Um a lot of apps you might kind of go to messages Um and that and create 00 16 58 messages do that on Facebook what you do is a lot of people navigate to go to a person and they choose to send him a message or write on their wall or view their photos or whatever they re going to do Um and we just think that this model is a more engaging way to build apps and you know so we built a bunch of them ourselves Whether it s photos or videos  Walt Right   Um and what we we have this strategy where what we re trying to do is make it possible for everyone to build different social apps um that are basically designed with people at their center and that s what we um a lot of the stuff that we started talking about at F8 00 17 28 right Um we started the strategy around 2007 where people could build apps inside Facebook There are now more than a million developers doing that um ranging from you know the largest companies like Zynga that have really started the whole social gaming thing that s now multibillion dollar industry um to a lot of hobbyist developers and what we re trying to do now is make it so that people can extend that outside of Facebook right because we never thought that it would all kind of stick within one website to the rest of the web Um so we have focused on a number of different things 00 18 00 that make it so that people can build these people centric um websites um and apps on their phones and desktop software and one of the main things that we ve done is social plug ins right Which basically um is it makes it means that we have a single line of code you can just kind of insert uh a plug in onto your site A lot of new sites have done it ABC a lot of different new sites and a that is a really simple way to personalize your site  Kara Right   Right and um those actually since I inaudible 00 18 32 200 000 different sites have started using social plug ins um and most of them have seen that their referral rate from Facebook users has gone up by about 2X right So it s been a big increase in terms of the engagement on the site um that people have gotten from making their site more designed from the ground up around people  Walt Right so I get that I get that part   Now in terms of getting the instant personalization is um kind of the other side of that program right We re trying to make it so that um you know all of these sites can be designed around people you know all these different websites applications and social plug ins I think are going to be the primary way that that happens but for sites that um are you know more technical and want to build things um build you know kind of the whole stack themselves we wanted to have a program where we could partner with just a handful of sites um to make it so that they can use only the information that s open to everyone on Facebook to personalize things So for example um Pandora um is an application where you can go and if you set your music to be visible to everyone then it can access your music and it can start playing songs that you like as soon as you show up on their site and it s a great integration Um and it s a good personalized experience as soon as you used it that they have kind of coded in collaboration with us That s kind of how we see this whole picture of building  Walt Why not say why not when I log onto Facebook say hey we ve got this new thing with Pandora if you happen to also like Pandora uh which would do just what you just describe which sounds great   Mm hmm  Walt Check here if you want to do it You did it kind of the 00 20 00 opposite you   We have that program It s regular connect right I mean the like any website  Kara This has been very popular  Walt Right but what s the problem 00 20 08   Yeah so hundreds and thousands of sites have used it  Walt So why did you sort of put up a notice saying uh Mic what is it Microsoft do docs uh withthe other one was Yelp I think   Yeah so docs Yelp and  Walt and Pandora   partners with us So what we found is that  Walt You are automatically now instantly personalized there   Um  Walt Without asking   So what we have found is that you know so a lot of sites are using connect It s more than 100 000  Walt Right   um but it s actually even though it s just one click to click on this blue button to use connect um it s a lot more friction than I think it seems right Because like you go to a site like Yelp or you go to a site like Pandora and it s you re going to because you want to use Pandora so not immediately clear what you get if you have a personalized experience or if the site were had if it knew who all your friends were So that s why we re doing the push both around social plug ins and around instant personalization um at the same time Right it s this big push were we just think that all of these different products are going to get an order of magnitude better when they re designed with people of their core  Walt But shouldn t people make the decision themselves to opt in on it This is my last question on this seriously but I don t understand applause yeah thanks Shouldn t people uh I m sorry if you don t think it s important but I do So shouldn t people have to opt in   No so I think that the you know making these products that people can share and that people have control and that are simple to do both is this balance right and opt in versus opt out is one part of that balance right So for example we ve got a lot of products this time that s going on When we launched the first version of Facebook um there was there were no messages on the site right So I think clearly when we added messages it I think it s fine to make it so I mean you can go now and you can turn off messages if you want You can make it so people can t message you um but that we thought that was right to have as an opt out thing um similarly when we launched newsfeed you now there s a pretty big backlash around that I mean that was actually per the ratio of Facebook users Um 10 of Facebook users were protesting and a lot of that what people wanted was let us turn it on or at least you know just make it so that people have to choose to turn it on before they can use newsfeed um and looking back on it I think newsfeed is such a critical part of the experience that it would have been pretty crazy if now for you know when you sign up for Facebook if you had to choose that you want to turn on each individual one of these features if newsfeed wasn t there by default I mean there are whole services that they are now is a newsfeed  Walt Okay   Um so I just think I think it s a balance on all these things and  Kara If you use some of the picking and other people do some of the picking   And yeah and I don t know if we always get it right and we always to listen to feedback and do what we think are the right things um but my prediction would be that a few years from now we ll look back and wonder why there was ever this time when all these websites and applications whether they re mobile applications or websites weren t personalized in some way Whether it s through social plug ins or connect or instant personalization or whatever programs other companies come out with but I just think the world is moving in this direction where thinks are going to be designed more around people um and I think that it s going to be a really power direction  Kara Let s talk about where that s going Let s talk about the next phase in social networking Here you are you ve gone to 5 close you re about to announce 500 million users and have a lovely party I understand Um what are you going to a billion what s the go what is the next phase in social network because you have such a massive influence on the rest of the ecosystem now What do you know 00 23 33 What are the what are three or four things you see on the short term horizon or long term horizon  Walt Well I think the industry is it s come a long way in the last five years right From the sites like Friendster and Myspace and the first version of Facebook that were really these wild garden sites um to now becoming more of a social platform and I just think that that trend is going to continue So what we found 00 24 00 was you know Facebook built a lot of these apps itself um early on We built photos Um we built groups we build events and those are um respectively the most used photos groups events um applications online and along the way we just realized you know we re never going to build all of these applications ourselves It will be the wrong strategy for us to try to do that So we started building this platform and opening up um overtime and you know it s and it s interesting because the privacy concerns that people around having their information with third party applications is something that I think overtime um people use these applications They have a good experience with them They understand the controls that they have and they can get more comfortable as that happens So that s one of the reasons why you know when we started with applications we started off building it inside Facebook to begin with But the goal is never to have all these applications built inside Facebook it was to make it so that every application that gets built and every industry um can be designed in this new way around people first and um that s really the direction that I think it s going in So you know first we built kind of some of the core apps then platform inside Facebook then connect now social plug ins and instant personalization Um and I think we re gonna look out you know over the next few years and a lot of the industries that there hasn t been innovation in for a while are gonna have new applications built that are built with people of their core  Kara Such as   Um such as anything I mean I think um I think Yelp is actually a really interesting example where you know there have been directories of businesses for a long time but now um you know now for the first time there s it s there s the service where you can go and you can see what your friends like and you can see what people around you are reviewing and people that you respect and um and just being able to go now and I mean Yelp is one of the instant personalization partners and being able to see what the people around you are connected to I just think it adds an element to the experience that is both qualitatively good and is extremely good for engagement and use of the sites  Walt Can I ask you what you think is mean by the social graph 00 26 00 Is that something that Facebook controls or somebody else controls or what s the social graph and secondly how can it be monetized in a way that s   Mm hmm  Walt you know uh fair to people who use it who are included in it   Well I mean so the idea of the social graph that we I mean we just we introduced this at the first F8 00 26 22 in 2007 when we rolled out platform and it was kind of our way of explaining the phenomenon that we thought was happening in the world and um the idea of the social graph is that um you know if you map out all of the connections between people in the world that it would form this graph and you know what we are trying to do with Facebook is just try to map out um the connections that people have because we think that once those connections are mapped out then you can start to offer all these great social products um both as part of Facebook com and you know all the different Facebook services that people use Facebook mobile all the things like that but also start to enable this broader platform where people can build games they can build um they can start to remake any site or application on the web around knowing who you know um and kind of personalizing things to you So there is some interesting thing because I think a lot of people have characterized it as if somehow we own the graph or we re trying to own the graph or someone else has a graph and um it s not really how you intended it at all I mean we think that there is a graph in the world and that the best that anyone can do is try to map it out and that even better now with some of the open graph stuff that we re doing when different services can pull their different respective parts of maps of the graphs together then you can build even better services that combine all of the stuff together  Kara And how do you look at Facebook s role in the graph You re a very big part of this graph if that s the case if it s built around people a lot of things have been built around search They ve been built around all kinds of things but not necessarily people Where does Facebook what kind of power are you in this graph   Well I think people rely on us for two things I mean one is just the service that they use on a day to day 00 28 00 basis um to you know share and stay connected with the people around them and their friends but also I think people look at us as the leader in the space and I know there s a pretty widely held belief that as far as social networking has come You know and having almost half a billion users it s certainly a pretty cool milestone that we re definitely proud of that we can serve that many people I think that people generally also believe that we re much closer to the beginning of the space than we are to the end and I think that s a them in a lot of the changes that we make is that we you know it would be easy for us to just kind of keep things going the same as they are right And you know we grow because um people because people refer their friends to the site we do know advertising So you know everyone who signs up for the site um is doing it because one of their friends told them to get on the site and certainly you know on a day to day basis we didn t disrupt things that would be kind of the easiest ways to proceed but we don t believe that if we did that um we d be doing the best thing for you know either us long term or for the industry or for where we hope the world gets to So you know we continue to do what we think are the right changes even if some of them are controversial especially with the time when we do them Um and we think that that s a lot of what kind of people are counting on us to do as the leader on the space  Walt And what s your how does the social graph get monetized in   Well there are two kind of primary ways I mean one is we can provide really good relevant advertising to people because they tell us exactly what they re interested in and who they know and you know those people tell us what they re interested in  Walt Right   So that s one piece of it where I think the the advertising in these systems I think will get much more relevant than that in a lot of other systems very quickly I mean there s some stat coded today about how the number of advertisers in the system has grown by 4X over the last um year and a half alone and we re just having all those different ads in the system It makes it so there s more to draw from and that people get more relevant ads The other part is run engagement right because what people are doing on the site is they re 00 30 00 sharing stuff at with their friends and the ads reflect that as well right So I mean they re interesting examples um like what we re doing with Starbucks where um this was their first uh I think one of their first major online ad campaigns and you know they now have more than 7 people are connected who are fans and like the Starbucks presence online and the ad campaign that they did was around basically giving away some free products in their stores Um and the ad was basically it said okay here there is this day where you can there s free stuff and um and people invited their friends and their friend It was basically an event on the site um and people basically engaged their friends and got their friends to go So in the same way the people are organically sharing information on the site Um people are doing that around these brands as well and it s proven to be really efficient for this advertizing  Kara So how who do you see is your competitors Who do you we asked this at F8 00 30 54 back and forth then who do you actually when you think about competition or do you think about it at all who do you think about as your major people that you think about over again 00 31 03   You know I mean there s all the usual suspects in the space but I think you know we have such a different approach than others you know in terms of trying to build the web in this way from the ground up around people I mean some of the folks have different approaches like how Google focuses on you know building it around links right And different other companies focus on building um building out the ecosystem around different things I mean Apple is around apps right and I mean certainly I mean I think we confuse different companies in different ways but I mean one thing that I try to do in running the company is not make some of the same mistakes that I ve seen other companies make We try to make different mistakes and um  Walt  laughs  Kara You re doing a good job  Laughing   Thank you  Walt  laughs   Um and you know one mistake that I think a lot of companies make is they focus on whether the big companies in the space that could potentially be their big competitors and I think people kind of over rotate on that sometimes I mean the big example was 00 32 00 um you know in all the early Apple clips you know there s all the stuff about how Apple and Steve Jobs are trying to rally people against IBM but really what they need to worry about was a smaller company right that few people have heard of at the time and you know I think that s probably more after And the world is changing so quickly now um with mobile stuff and um and these different platforms emerging that I think it s more likely that the biggest competitor for us is something we haven t heard of and I think what that means for us is that we should just really stay focused on what we re doing right I think we have a pretty ambitious goal for the world and what we think will make the web better what we think will make all these businesses that integrate with us run more effectively what we think will be disruptive and make it so that new business can grow and I think if we stay focused on doing that um that s really the main thing that we need to do So I really that s kind of it s not you know it s not um  Kara  crosstalk 00 32 54  Walt A perfectly legitimate answer that s your answer  Kara Um you re gonna be the CEO of this company when it goes public   Um  Kara Mark that s your intent   Yeah I mean yeah  Kara Okay and what   I I don t I mean I don t think about going public as much  Kara How do you feel as being as well do you have a date   No  Kara Okay   I mean we re really just focused on building the stuff that we re doing now I mean it s actually kind of crazy how much stuff is changing right now and the last time I was on stage at D we had that was two years ago right And we had less than 100 million people using the service Um we haven t launched connect yet right So the only platform that there was was people building these apps inside Facebook and I mean that s two years right and I think you know the next few years I think are going to be as transformative as the last two years if not more Um because I m really excited about the stuff that we re doing with plug ins and instant personalization and some other things that will do going forward that we re just gonna make it so that people can remake their businesses in this way that it s focused around people and um and you know as the stats kind of come out around how partners are using the 00 34 00 stuff and the success that they re having you know the massive increase in referrals that they re getting in traffic that they re getting from plug ins or the massive increase in registrations that people are getting from different plug ins and instant personalization Um I think it s just gonna be a really compelling move to change a lot of the way that the web works toward being built not just around web um links but around people And I think that that s gonna be exciting and  Kara  crosstalk 00 34 23 sharing this time as people people   Well I mean I say sharing a lot so too but um  Walt Famous is  Kara That s because how do you think you are what have you learned as a CEO in the past two years How do you ve evolved We talked about this a little last time   Yeah  Kara You re talking about some things get to you I mean you re not happy about this movie coming out but I   Well I mean I just wish that no one made a movie about me when I was alive  Kara Okay laughing Did you eat koala meat   What s that  Kara Did you eat koala meat   I don t even know if you can eat koala meat  Kara Okay all right excellent Um how do you see yourself as a CEO What is your leadership style   You know I ve always just focused on a couple of things around this and one is kind of having a clear direction for the company and what we build Um and the other is just trying to build the best team possible towards that and um you know in terms of a clear direction I think we have a pretty clear team behind all of the things that we re doing whether it s the product that we re building internally and over the next year one of the things I m really excited about is we re building a lot of apps that we think are really cool too but and then obviously all the platform stuff we re really excited about um just because of the success that we think that that s gonna bring partners and how that s gonna enable um people who are using the web type have pretty different experience Um so there s just a huge amount of effort going on around that and then on the people side um just continuing to bring in great people and put them in roles where they re empowered is a big focus for what we do So in the last couple of years um I mean today we announced that and I just promoted Bret Taylor to be our CTO and he joined us during the front feed acquisition Um we ve done a number of 00 36 00 town 00 36 00 acquisitions and then we really are out in the valley trying to find the most talented people or entrepreneurial and we want to build an entrepreneurial company and we think the key part of doing that is meaning means that at all levels of the company including the senior management you need to have entrepreneurs and you need to have technical people So um I mean we re recruiting and trying to get the very best people that we can to those roles and you know so it s a balance from that and people who have grown inside the company like Chris Cox our head of products He started off as an engineer on the original newsfeed team and is one of the most phenomenal people who I know and you know everyone who works with him says that to also we have folks who joined us like Sheryl um on you know the business side to build up all of our operations around the world um and she s doing a phenomenal job bring in great people and in building things up So I think as a company if you get those two things right um having a clear direction on what you re trying to do and bring in great people who can execute on this stuff then you can do pretty well and that s what we ve focused on  Walt Well you did well here So thank you  Kara You did well Very good I m sorry for taking off your hoodie but it was a good idea   No I clearly needed to do that  Applause  Kara Questions for Mark  Applause   Sure  Walt Rob  Rob Yeah Hey Mark Um kind of a simple question um do you realize that you have already built at the age of 26 one of the maybe five most important internet companies in the world Which is an amazing accomplishment and then correlate to that that the world kind of looks at you differently as a result and that there s kind of this interesting challenge I saw this in my 10 years in Microsoft and didn t see it at my 15 years at Rio 00 37 38 but I saw a little version of it I guess that the world looks at you differently and that it s almost like the expectation changes like nobody puts out a banner and tells you that And how do you deal with that both I mean it really inaudible 00 37 50 professionally It s a personal question too but I mean the fact that already Facebook is maybe I mean Google Microsoft Amazon Apple I don t know who else I d put in the list so as I said five  Kara This is a 00 38 00 great common area go ahead  Rob Yeah how do you deal with that realization that the world is looking at you and Facebook differently than it did one or two years ago because of the amazing success of what you ve done   You know maybe I m in denial Um you know I think our goals haven t really changed much at all right and inside the company and we don t think of ourselves as a company that s successful right So we I mean we know that We have these products that people use and that they love and that this site is growing because people share with their friends and we see platform and how that s growing and how it s successful for the businesses that work with us and we see the advertising stuff and we see how that s going and creating some of the best campaigns that our partners who ever had but um you know it s just it goes back to this concept where I just think we re a lot closer at the beginning than the end And um I don t know I mean I guess as companies get bigger people expect you to slow down and do less crazy stuff um and I guess I hope we never do that and you know So in 00 39 05 personally I don t know I guess I have a core group of people who I really trust um a lot of them I ve worked with for a long time for five years um since we really started laughing um  Walt Really That s good   Yeah um laughing the company s only six years old  Kara You know any less   You know and and and for the first year it wasn t really even a company right because I mean it was this project at Harvard Before we moved out we didn t even start hiring people until you know five years ago but um you know whether it s them or my friends I think you know that s what I care about right I mean they re people who share my values and the values of the company and who think that making the world more open and connected is a good thing Um and that s what we re trying to do and you know I think it s kind of inevitable I guess that whenever we make a change or at this scale Um there are gonna be some people who think what we re doing is cool and some people who don t 00 40 00 And I um I don t know I guess we try to not let that get to us and we just try to do what we think are the right things to do and then list in for feedback and tweak from there  Walt Thanks Rob Esther  Esther This is two questions which you may actually have the same answer and the first is who s your role model and why and the second is accepting people who are at Facebook and yourself who would be the best person to run Facebook   Hah I don t know if I can answer either of those questions Who s my role model I mean there s so many people I look to for different things I mean there are so many amazing people who um who built great things in this industry but yeah I mean I le I feel like I learned the most from the people who are around me now and who I ve worked with overtime right And you if something happened to me um I think you could pick any of the core people on Facebook and they would on the management team and they would all do a good job running the company and I mean that s I think how you want to build these companies right Is that um you know I think people really share the vision of what we re trying to do and you try to build people not and and sort of hire people not just to be able to do a role but because they can you know run run the whole company right I mean and I think it s important because we re still a pretty small company I think that s pretty important to remember it So for the footprint that we have having you know only around a thousand people is I think relatively pretty small but I think that one of the things that that means is that the companies ultimately grow a lot over the next few years and it s gonna be an exciting period Um but we want to have people around us who we try to make good decisions as it s growing and who can run things that are a lot bigger than what they re doing now Um so I really think that any of the core people would be good choices  Esther Yeah it was not a practical question Laughs  Walt Thanks Esther  Dave Hi Mark Dave Dave Geller A lot of us are using the e mail clients and services from Gmail and Yahoo and Hotmail and we re also using your platform of course 00 42 00 I ve heard that you re planning to offer basically an e mail platform so that people can just use Facebook for everything Is that true   Um you know we re working on a number of things but we re not building a webmail competitor Um people do messaging on Facebook right So it s one of the primary use cases of what people do  Dave It s outside of the Facebook world in and out of your platform like an e mail platform   Yeah I mean I think that this is actually one of the most interesting things that s going on today is communication is getting to be shorter form more informal and more frequent right So um I think that SMS is a much more interesting platform or IM than e mail is today and it s also I mean status updates are increasingly common and they re probably in order of magnitude more people posting status updates than write long form blog posts Right So you know there are definitely these great services that people use that are these full webmail clients That s not what Facebook is right I mean Facebook has a messaging um application and has an IM application which interestingly enough the IM thing is run by one person I think it s maybe the second largest IM network in the world Um and so I mean there s a lot of room for improvement in these things just because it s so basic in terms of what we re doing right now compared to what we can be doing but I think that a lot of the opportunities can be around fusing these shorter form communication higher frequency less formal things together not in doing the e mail stuff that people have been doing in the past  Kara  inaudible 00 43 34  Male We talked about the power of defaults and privacy settings and decisions that you ve made How are decisions made uh at your company about important decisions like that So for example Microsoft does a lot of uh prototyping with customers Google does AB testing Steve Jobs uh purportedly makes the last call himself Um how does it happen for Facebook   So 00 44 00 we re a company where there s a lot of open dialogue inside the company and have only you know five core values and being open inside of the company is one of them For example we feel like if we want to lead this trend outside of the company then that s a really important thing for us to do inside the company as well So we have crazy dialogue and arguments um people send out ideas I mean every Friday I have an open Q A where anyone in the company can come and ask me any question they want People ask me um hard questions right So it s actually you know should have been pretty good practice for this Um but um it s not I wear my hoodie there and it s fine Um laughing um but you know our style is really two things Um we like to innovate doing what we think is kind of the principal the right thing to do um and build the product that we think is the right thing Um but because we are a web product those are changed pretty quickly So we also listen in real time to the feedback that we re getting from people and that takes two primary um formats I mean one is we listen to all the kind of anecdotal feedback on the e mails that we get or the posts that people make on Facebook the blog posts that they write Um all the things that people tell us but we also look at the data of how people are actually using this site right and how people are using the products that we launch because we know that you know people a lot of time when we ll change something um they won t like the change but we ll be able to tell very quickly how they re using the products and whether they re being able to use them to share more whether they re promoting the site more to their friends or um whatever they re doing And um you know in response to the most recent stuff that we did um we innovated we changed a lot of the products around platform to be what we thought that they should be Um and that had this privacy implications and we did what we thought were the right things around the defaults Um and then we listen We got a lot of feedback and the biggest point of feedback that we got was that people wanted simpler controls So we actually you know a team of us we just we hold 00 46 00 up in a conference room for two weeks to go crank out a new set of settings and you know I was there for a lot of it and a lot of other folks who were there and they didn t sleep and then change clothes and then we re just there and they built this thing and then we shipped it So I mean that s how the company works  Kara Do you make a lot of the last calls on big decisions   Um yeah I mean if it s something that needs to you know get a tie broken or something like that or it s a really important thing then definitely people would bring it to me and I ll make those decisions  Kara Right very quick last two questions  Male Okay uh  Kara Very quick  Male Just want to make a quick question about the Flash versus HTML file A lot of people onstage have been talking about how much they love the iPad but when you want to use Facebook there are some aspects of it that don t work like Farmville and there s millions of people who play that So when it comes to Facebook what s your sort of opinion on the two technology Should you have to make a Facebook HD app for people to get the full experience or should it happen on the web   You know I mean we re agnostic I think on that I tend to believe more in the web than apps personally but I think we ll see and I think that there will be both I think there s a real reason why there are apps on mobile phones specifically I just think that the internet connections and the power in CPU are not effective enough to have the best HTML experience yet Um but I think that will change we ll see how it goes and there are these two good platforms The thing that I actually care a lot 00 48 00 more about is it s not the vertical about is it s not the vertical platform of kind of you have the operating system and then you have an app or you have a browser and then you have a website It s how you integrate um people into all of these stuff right And so it s a different cut of the problem I think Um and we just want to build tools that people can um can make all the stuff good So I mean on phones actually I think a lot of the stuff is a lot easier to do I mean when you buy an Android phone one of the first things that you do is you can sign in with your Facebook account and it just brings all of your um all of your friends into the contact address book and I mean this is something that I think a lot of people may not know about um how iPhone and Android phones work but every application that runs automatically gets access to all of your friends and all of the contacts that are there Um so in a way I think it s going to be a lot easier to have these great personalized and instantly social experiences um on those devices um than on the web because of some of the expectations that people have around how the stuff works today Um but I think it will get there for all of this stuff I just think it will take a bit of time Um but that s the trend that I m the most focused on  Kara Okay last very quickly  Walt  Stewart 00 49 03  Male Hey Mark Uh you almost answered the question there but uh Facebook crashes regularly on my iPhone and I don t have an iPad specific version of Facebook and I wonder uh if you could go a little further in terms of uh you know what it means to Facebook to have mobile apps and you just referred to how you know socializing we all have our phones with us here but we don t have our computers So we re really using our phones as a way to gain access to Facebook and to socialize with our friends What is the role of the phone   Yeah I mean we our mobile experiences growing really quickly So we re I I don t want to misquote any stats but I know that you know it s well more than 100 million people are using Facebook on their mobile phones now and that s grown by three or four X in the last year alone So I mean that s growing in a much faster rate than the web version is but people use 00 50 00 all different ways I mean a lot of people use the web on my iPad I use the website Um and I think that that s it s kind of all you need Um on the iPhone the app is great Um there is Zero which we launched recently which is a trimmed down version for markets where um the bandwidth  Kara  inaudible 00 50 18   Yeah it s I mean we re so people can get access to it You can get free access to Facebook um free data because there are actually no pictures I mean that s stripped out of that version of it but um these are on in areas where the bandwidth is just a lot slower So you know I think that one of the challenges and one of the things that s interesting about mobile is that there s no standard platform yet It s not like the web where you know six years ago and I was getting started building Facebook There is no question on what I was going to build on It was going to be a website and it was kind of clear how that was gonna work Now it was unclear if it s gonna be Android is it gonna be iPhone it s gonna be HTML5 or apps or any number of other platforms Um and I think that that s a challenge but it s also kind of cool to see what experiences you can make possible in these different things and triangulate off of those to get to figure out where we re hoping to be So  Male Are you gonna have iPad Are you gonna have an iPad   I assume eventually we will Yeah I mean the company is it s an interesting to remember but as we re still a pretty small company um you know I was running this e mail announcing Bret s new role as CTO and I was talking about some of the projects that he s gonna get involved in um and and you know I was talking about newsfeed which I think is gonna be one of them Which is the homepage for you know more than 250 million people every day and the team of people that works on it is um 11 people and you know search We have this great type head and people do queries and the number of queries is on the order of magnitude of um of what Google is doing and it s not what Google is doing but it s on the same order of magnitude and the team working on searches um is 12 people I think And um and even if the whole team who are working on platform which we 00 52 00 hope will blossom to be the foundation of this whole industry is I think it s around 25 or 30 people and you know I talked about IM before and that was one person So um we have a lot more to do Right and I mean that s like one I think the most exciting things for the next few years is we re nowhere near the set of things that we think should get built um and I think that s one of the exciting things about working with Facebook now It s one of the exciting things about doing what we re doing and um just a cool place to be  Kara Great Mark Thank you so much  Walt Thank you Mark  Applause  Background conversation 00 52 28  Music '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2010-011', 'content': ' Article There s no shortage of big initiatives going on at Facebook these days We sat down with Facebook CEO  this week to talk about the state and future of Facebook and its surrounding ecosystem Zuckerberg shared his thoughts on recent changes to the Facebook Platform competitive dynamics he desires amongst developers the surprising growth of the social games business on Facebook overall his vision for Facebook Credits market perceptions of Facebook s revenue streams and overall revenue numbers what the company learned from its period of serious interest in Twitter and Facebook s company culture around money Today Facebook s 1 400 employees are working on products to better serve and monetize its nearly 500 million monthly active users around the world up from 150 million at the start of 2009 We estimate the company did between 600 to 700 million in revenues last year and will see between 1 and 1 1 billion in overall revenues this year As Facebook s business has grown so has the Facebook Platform economy Developers of social games on the Facebook Platform will earn hundreds of million of dollars in revenues in 2010 according to our Inside Virtual Goods The Future of Social Gaming 2010 report and tens of thousands of businesses are shifting more of their marketing efforts and dollars to build their Facebook presence  Interviewer What s the state of the platform right now in terms of the alignment of incentives between developers and Facebook and users compared to where it was just after the Platform launched a couple of years ago and where you want it to be   There s two parts of the Platform there s canvas and then everything outside of Facebook The focus now is actually the latter Connect and everything we re doing with social plugins We have an all hands meeting later today and I was just told that Connect is now on 1 million sites That s definitely an increasing focus and the last two f8 s have been around that But I think what you re asking is about the canvas part There are two ways that apps get usage that really define the character of the application One way is viral distribution spreading to new people The other is reengagement Early on the viral strength was so much but there were really no channels for reengagement So people were using viral channels to reengage people and you basically had apps that were growing very quickly and their best way to get a good user count was to get new users and churn through them That really optimizes for apps that are very viral instead of apps that are high quality and that people want to reengage So we intentionally weakened the viral channels recently and intentionally strengthened reengagement with emails so that there will be better apps It s going to be a long process but I think it s going reasonably well One of the things we did recently was rebalance around games A lot of users like playing games but a lot of users just hate games and that made it a big challenge because people who like playing games wanted to post updates about their farm or frontier or whatever to their stream They want all their friends to see their updates and they want to get all their friends updates but people who don t care about games want no updates So we did some rebalancing so that if you aren t a game player you re getting less updates One of our goals that we have is to make it so that you have just as good of a chance to build a good game if you re a standalone game shop as if you re a part of a bigger conglomerate like Zynga or EA That is a long term thing to make sure the market stays competitive around this CrowdStar has grown pretty quickly in the last 6 months from very small to now pretty big That to me shows that it s definitely not a one company market and that s what we re looking for A lot of what we re working on is can a small company succeed in the space  Interviewer What do you think about how big the games business has become on the platform You told me a couple of years ago soon after the Platform launched that you weren t really thinking about games when you built the Platform   I was surprised I was surprised about games I had a conversation with some folks at Apple at one point and they were surprised that games was the big thing on the iPhone too I also heard anecdotally that the people making the first PC operating systems were surprised that games were that big too So I think people build platforms for utilitarian purposes and then get surprised that games are a killer app so I don t think it s uncommon But clearly a lot of people like them Someone once wrote that I don t like games and I think that s pretty silly I don t spend a lot of time playing games myself but it s really cool as a first proof example of an industry that s getting completely disrupted by the whole social movement All the dynamics of how you play the game getting neighbors trade with people do tasks with people to more efficiently use your resources It s the first place where someone completely wove in social dynamics into the dynamics of the industry and it works really well The early games like Jetman and Boggle and things like that weren t that social but now when you hear gaming companies talk about the next generation of games that they re creating everything is about integrating the social stuff more and more deeply into the game Now there are companies like Zynga EA Playfish CrowdStar but then there s a Facebook version of Civilization as well so it s going in both directions The Civ game is your traditional high quality game but the big question there is whether they leverage social dynamics enough The risk for them is that it might just end up being a good traditional game with very little social integration  Interviewer One of the questions that people I talk to have these days is what role Credits will have in the future of the company How important is Credits in terms of your overall product priorities do you think it will succeed and how important will it be in terms of revenue   It makes sense that there should be one currency If I go play a CrowdStar game right now and get Credits there I can t go use those Credits in a Zynga game so that kind of sucks One of the biggest inefficiencies in buying virtual goods is all the friction of having to take your credit card out so having one store of virtual currency that you can use everywhere is both good for users and good for all the apps The other thing about Credits from our business perspective is that payments and Credits is a significantly lower margin business than ads Ads are 20 30 40 A lot of people are skeptical of when we say we are doing this primarily for the developer ecosystem but that s really how we think about it A lot of the apps so far are games a lot of games monetize a lot better through virtual goods than through ads and a big goal for us is to build this level ecosystem So if Zynga or any one player can allow cross payments within their games but that doesn t extend to other games then that ends up being a big barrier to entry for other startups Making it so that there is one currency that people can take everywhere levels the playing field a bit which is good We want to make it as easy as possible for users to build up a liquidity of Credits themselves so we re planning on pouring all the money that we make on Credits back into things like different offers or cards that people can buy in stores to lubricate the economy so people will buy more stuff in apps Overall we think it s better for everyone for us to be in that place Now if we fail we fail and someone else will succeed But I think that over the long term this will end up being a pretty valuable thing  Interviewer When we spoke in the spring of 2009 you said you felt like there were misperceptions in the market around Facebook s revenues and soon thereafter you guys released some financial data points to adjust people s expectations Do you think that expectations today are more accurate We estimate your 2010 revenues at 1 to 1 1 billion   I think it s really hard to predict this stuff The biggest driver for revenues and costs for us is the number of users Last year we went from 150 to 350 million users how could you predict that Over a longer time horizon it doesn t matter that much For how early social media is you want to be looking at longer trends You can have blips over a six month or one year period but it doesn t necesarily say that much The reason we corrected it last year is because it was hurting us People thought it was too low Now what I would say is that the estimates are not so far off in either direction that it s causing us any pain so we feel no need to correct it Also if it was too high we would want to correct it too because we don t want expectations to be too high and we don t want people to be disappointed if they joined I think people are getting a better feel for it but in general I think people underestimate the value of the whole thing  Interviewer There was a time over the last year and a half when you and the company became more engaged with Twitter and then there was a time when you weren t What did you learn from that   At first I think we learned that they do a lot of things really well It s a very nice simple service They do one thing really well that s powerful I think the main thing was we looked at their growth rate and well we saw our exponential growth rate continue for a very long period of time and it still does at a super linear rate though not quite 3 a week any more I looked at their rate and thought if this continues for 12 months or 18 months then in a year they re going to be bigger than us I guess I extrapolated too much from our own experience of what was possible but it just turned out that that their growth rate was kind of unnatural They got a lot of media attention and it grew very quickly for a little period of time Most of the lessons I take away from the whole thing now are that as good as I think they are I think I personally just paid too much attention to it I don t think we over rotated as a company on it but it was interesting because we re a pretty young company and we haven t had that many other companies in our space Learning how you work with other companies is an interesting thing that I ll hopefully figure out over the next decade and it was just interesting learning from watching them  Interviewer What particular product insights did you gain from that experience   The way that people use the products are pretty different It s just interesting that they do some things that we explicitly don t want to do but do them well For example they don t do real names and they have themes It s a lot more around self expression than real identity but I think it works for them But that doesn t mean we want to be that Watching them is going to be really interesting over the next few years and the same with FourSquare and a lot of other social companies  Interviewer Can you talk any more about your plans for your location products   Well we re developing something but nothing besides that We want to make sure that we do it well and we re taking the time to do that  Interviewer From what I ve observed it appears as though you ve established a culture here that does not respect people who cash out early Could you talk about the role that money plays in building the organization   I guess we have a pretty utilitarian view towards money Sometimes what I say gets misinterpreted as I don t care about money but that s really not true I think building a company is the best way to change the world because it s the best way to align the interests of a lot of smart people and a lot of partners to build something that s great and that serves people You can t do that if you re an individual because it s just you and there s no one to align and you can t do it if you re a non profit because you have no resources and you re constantly out trying to raise money instead of generating it and being self sufficient That s I guess the view At this point in the company s evolution I don t see a huge need for the company to be throwing off a huge amount of profit What s the point If we believe that we can build a lot more value for users developers and advertisers by taking any excess money we can make and investing it back in then we re just going to grow those communities and markets faster and we re going to end up with greater potential in the long run If you prematurely optimize you might get a bigger piece of a smaller thing I feel like we re really early on in the start of this movement toward everything being social But even people who are very smart a lot of times throughout the history of the company have underestimated how far it would go That s been difficult because when you have key people who have that attitude it s hard to get stuff done Especially around selling the company early on and choosing not to do that that was a big learning moment for the company in terms of what kind of people we wanted to have here I just want the people we have here to be focused on building stuff and that s how we run it '}\n"

involved with the museum it s a pleasure to welcome you here tonight to this event It is the latest installment in our series of programs on the 40th anniversary of the events that led to today s fully wired world I want to begin by thanking Intel for serving as the lead sponsor of our Net at 40 series Intel is a very generous supporter and a good friend to the museum We very much appreciate they re underwriting of these programs Along the way we ve also had support from Semantic Corporation and of course our donors and members who in the last 12 months have provided more than two million dollars in support for our work Kepler s is the museum partner for books related to our programs as they are tonight They ll be selling the Facebook Effect after our program I want to thank Clark Kepler for their ongoing partnership Clark is here tonight Clark thank you And finally thank you to HP and its MagCloud service which is the partner for the publication of the booklets that are on your chairs and around the museum tonight All of our MagCloud publications are now available for purchase online in case you didn t get one tonight or you want to order one for a friend A member of the museum emailed me a few days ago with this note He said I hope when you re introducing the Facebook event you ll remind everyone that we re here tonight because two guys named Kline and Duvall were hunched over computers late one night in 1969 trying to send the letters l o g i n from SRI to UCLA over the ARPANET So there I ve done my duty alphabet soup and all The connection between the launch of the ARPANET and relative solitude 40 years ago and the explosion of Facebook is not linear as we have covered in previous events and in the history that s printed tonight but without 00 02 00 question our global society is surly traveling at breakneck speed down a continuum that began with l o g i n and today connects billions around the world This journey is at its core what this museum is all about If you reduced all of recorded human history to a 24 hour day the birth of the internet would amount to a fraction of a second The birth of Facebook and the socially connected electronic world far less than that and yet consider the immensity of the reality that we are all living in as little as two generation two generations we are moving from a time of no electronic connections at all to a time when we can hardly imagine not being connected We therefore confront an interesting paradox The blockbuster innovations of the information age are coming thick and fast And their impact is enormous as impactful as anything may have ever been And yet we risk losing their history as quickly as quickly as we see their history created This is the essence of the work of the museum We re seeking to capture the stories the firsthand accounts the lessons learned and the physical and digital products of both genius and failure in our time Or as Donna Dubinsky put it in her famous analogy from the film you saw a moment ago to talk to Michael Angelo as he paints the Sistine Chapel One big difference of course is that from time to time an historian of Michael Angelo s era might have found him flat on his back atop a scaffolding We don t find many people sitting still so what we are attempting is contemporary history at speed It s humbling and it s challenging But with the help of many 100 s of people we re determined to make it work and to make it worthwhile for generations to come That s why we have assembled the world s largest collection of more than 100 thousand items related to computing going all the way back to keyfoo 00 03 55 sticks and the ancient abacus and all the way forward to the iPad 00 04 00 it s why we have recorded nearly 500 oral histories of the men and women who have made history here in Silicon Valley and around the world It s why we have our fellows program the 52 portraits of which are collected on the wall just outside this auditorium They comprise some of the greatest figures in the history of technology It s why we undertake 20 to 30 programs like this every year All of which are fully viewable on our branded Youtube channel It s why we re the only major museum in the world with an internet history program and a fourth coming area of our revolution exhibit dedicated to the web and networking And finally it s why we have a vast digital museum at computerhistory org where among other things we release the original source code for Mac Paint and QuickDraw for the world to see for the first time yesterday morning Something our friends at Apple have at least to this point permitted only us to do Those of us in this branch of contemporary history do better when we stick together That s one reason why we re so delighted to be associated with David Kirkpatrick author of the fascinating book that we re exploring tonight and Facebook CEO  who just a few hours ago announced that the Facebook community has now exceeded this milestone 500 million users We may not know how history will ultimately write the Facebook story but two things are certain David Kirkpatrick has made an excellent start and his help and support was clearly instrumental Mark s help and support was clearly instrumental to David s exceptional story telling All of David s experience is on full display in the Facebook Effect 20 years as a senior writer at Fortune Magazine author of the Fortune Column Fast Forward founder host and program director of the Brainstorm Conference series founder of the Techonomy Conference kicking off next month at Lake Tahoe Conducting this conversation between David and Mark tonight is NPR s Guy Roz weekend host of All Things Considered one of the most sought after interviewers 00 06 00 in the business He has interviewed everyone from Arial Sharon to Eminem This marks a return trip to the museum for Guy who kicked off the Net at 40 series in the spring by interviewing ARPANET pioneer Bob Taylor If tonight is as freewheeling and candid as his evening with Bob Taylor was we are in for a real treat You can contribute to that with the question cards that are on your chair You can write your questions down We will be collecting them for Guy once we get a little further into the program Please join me now in welcoming Mark David and Guy to the stage for tonight s program Applause  Guy Okay well thank you very much John I m going to dispense with any opening remarks and dive right into the questions cause I think many of us here have many questions for both Mark and David The first question is for you David I just want you to give us a sense of what you mean when you talk about the Facebook effect what is that  David Well it s it s a generic kind of concept about all of the ways in which this massive social phenomenon social and technological phenomenon is changing the world And I you know I talk about politics governments business marketing identity privacy social life and other area really when you get to 500 million people on any system there are enormous ramifications and Facebook was designed from the beginning in order to have certain ramifications inaudible 00 07 33 successfully having  Guy  obviously congratulations are in order because of the announcement today on your Facebook page right Was it your Facebook page that I saw it or was it the blog post   Yeah we posted it a number of places  Guy Saw the video 500 million users that s double the number of users you had about a year ago Give me a sense of a Facebook moment over the past year 00 08 00 that has wowed you Something that has happened that you thought that the thing that I created made that happen   The thing that we did to commemorate now having 500 million people is we I just assembled the collection of stories that the people who used our service have written in to us over the years I can go get a few  Guy Yeah   They re really kind of amazing and and very varied right I mean everything from the the guy who is the last prime minster of Denmark found basically had a bunch of connections on his Facebook page and they became his jogging buddies  David I was going to put that in my book and I think I forgot yeah that s a good story laughing  Guy This Lars 00 08 51 Rasmussen right   Yes who I mean there was a mayor in a city in Connecticut who found that one of his constituents needed a I think it was a kidney and then went and donated his own kidney Um so it it like the stories that we hear from people range from these kind of incredibly profound things like that to just really kind of day to day things were people are just trying to stay connected with their friends and family and the people that they care about Now have a way to do that that s a lot easier than anything that they had before  Guy Do you ever get freaked out about how how powerful this tool that you invented has become that those things can happen Do you ever think   Well I mean its people doing them Right I think like the what we ve really built is a platform right I mean we re not building a system where people are donating organs I mean we re doing a system where people can stay connected with the people that they want to And um there s always been the ability for people to sit down face to face and have a conversation right I mean for awhile there s been the ability for people to call someone up no matter where they are 00 10 00 and it s been gotten a lot cheaper recently but to be able to have kind of a synchronous one way conversation with people who you re willing to call up right And who you have that level of comfort with But until recently there hasn t really been a good system for you to keep in touch with all of the other people who are in your life or you meet at some point who are important or were important and you want to keep up with but you don t have a way to talk to on a day to day basis and you wouldn t go out of your way to call and you would never sit down with in person And the power that s unlocked from that is really what we re seeing here right And when you can build up all of the value of those latent connections and keep them open this is the type of stuff that becomes possible But it s because people want to do it on their own anyway we re just kind of allowing people to have that the ability to do those things  David And all that is what I would call the Facebook effect I mean it was it was designed to be a viral platform for communications And you know I think it is a good point that Mark has made that Facebook is literally just a platform It has no content of its own whatsoever Everything there is created by its members And and and I think this this viral system that Mark effectively designed quite consciously where information flows especially because of a news feed from person to person with amazing efficiency if it s of interest that is sort of the root of the effect that s kind of the name of my book  Guy David in in John s introduction he mentioned Bob Taylor who was on this stage actually in your seat about two or three months ago He is not an international celebrity um most people in the world have not heard of Bob Taylor Far more know who  is he is arguably the father of computer to computer communication okay And you mention him in your book Which by the way is a great not just a primer on Facebook but a 00 12 00 fun book to read So  David Thank you  Guy Wanted to let you know that laughter Where where does  in view fit into the history of the internet or the history of communication  David Well I think that anybody who s created a system that gets to 500 million people particularly in six years deserves a fairly great prominence in the history of innovators in communication Um you know the world is changing so fast now that it s harder to put someone in the hierarchy the way we might of once felt comfortable doing So you know is Mark more important than Alexander Gram Bell or equally important I have I don t have a clue Laughing He doesn t think so I mean but you know we ll find out over time But you know I mean Facebook will not last as long as the telephone did I can assure you of that So we ll have to make our judgments more rapidly about these men laughing   You heard it here first Um  David I m not I m not saying it s not a great thing Mark but it s not going to telephones have been around for like 100 years You think Facebook will be here in 100 years literally you really do   I don t know but I don t know how long telephones are going to be around for laughing  David No no I mean no that that I agree with But I mean I mean I m talking about from its inception to today Do you think Facebook has a prospect of 100 years   I I don t know I don t know  David I mean literally but this is the question that I get all the time What s Facebook going to be in 10 years And I always say I cannot even begin to answer any question like that about any internet business Do you think it s a reasonable assumption that Facebook will be a strong and powerful business in 10 years or even I mean what do you think Is that the given   Oh 10 years I hope so  David Ten years okay what about 40 years   I I mean like I think that things change over time So I mean I think that you know if you look at some of the great technology companies they made a huge change in the world and then transitioned into great long term businesses I mean companies like IBM are 00 14 00 maybe not kind of at the forefront right now of consumer technology but are still great companies long after being the massive innovators in their space I think that these companies can be around for a very long period of time But I certainly that the trend that we re operating on now of helping people um share information which is really something that you know going back 20 years ago most people in society did not have the power to do I mean the internet has really brought that about Now everyone can share their opinions and information about themselves or what s going on around them And that that s a new thing and I think that s the trend that we re hoping to help push forward Um and I think that that s going to be one of the most transformative trends in society over the next 10 15 I mean who knows how long  Guy But but but can I ask one  David Sure  Guy The fact that a system could have grown to 500 million in a little over six years does suggest that the pace of change is truly accelerating   Oh yeah yeah  Guy So something else many other something else s are going to come along and burgeon with incredible speed So this is what I would say tell me if I m right about that that you d I would say that you take as a mantra only the paranoid survive And one of the reasons why you make all these changes that affect privacy and product is because you are literally afraid of the 4th square and the twitters and the other innovators and you do not want to be rendered irrelevant and you want Facebook to remain a vital cutting edge service and you know that requires constant change   Well I like to think a little more pro active than that  Guy What do you mean   I mean I don t think that the changes are motivated out of out of fear as much as wanting to help move the world forward  David Okay okay  Guy Let me ask you about moving the world forward because with with this incredible product you offer I m sure there isn t a person in this room who doesn t use it um I obviously use it Um you also have a very powerful database I believe the largest database of personal information that exists outside the realm of government right 00 16 00 Facebook if it were a country would be the third most populous in the world You are the head of a country I mean one out of 14 laughing  David Don t tell that to the inaudible 00 16 12 by the way   There s a lot of assertions going on up here that I don t agree with  Guy One out of 14 humans on planet earth is now has a Facebook profile   It doesn t make us a country laughter  Guy It does actually it does Five hundred million does It s an extraordinary number of people Do you remind yourself daily of the responsibility that that puts in your hands You re 26 years old You are a young guy I know that you re reminded of that all the time and I m sorry to do that again but you are And it s an immense amount of responsibility what do you how do you handle that responsibility   I mean I think the main thing is we ve just assembled the team as a company that has this tremendous sense of purpose for what we re doing right I mean It goes back to some of the questions that you were asking about building companies Where a lot of the people at Facebook including myself never thought we would be a part of a company I mean we I started Facebook and a lot of people who joined early on I think still join the company are doing it just because they believe in what we re doing And they believe that if you can give people tools to share information and stay connected with the people that they care about that that just opens up all these possibilities And then if you can build a development platform on top of which all these other people can build social applications then you can create a whole lot of new experiences that weren t possible before I think it s that kind of clarity around what we re trying to do um that I think is what give us the ability to keep on doing like these rounds of innovation instead of um you know the type of stuff that you re talking about like becoming a company Right  David People have a very hard time believing that about Facebook That s a fact I mean they really to be honest I don t think you do as good a job 00 18 00 communicating as you could the scope of the visions and the passion that you and you re colleagues as you describe share It s one aspect of my book that people challenge me on everywhere I go They cannot believe that Facebook isn t doing it for the money for the ad market place etcetera etcetera Could I just follow up with a specific question about this  Guy Sure  David One of the things that I know about you is you love product you love engineering what you would rather be doing is sitting at a terminal talking to the product team and the engineers to make the product better   I m doing that later tonight Laughter  David I know you will so probably every night But Facebook is as Guy is implying at sort of a turning point where its scale is requiring a new sort of responsibility on its part One of the questions that I have for you is you know do you really want to be the leader of a company that requires this constant interface with government and regulators around the world in order to you know keep explaining what it is you re doing because they are pushing back as you well know   And quite understandably because it s something you ve described as a utility So I mean the way that I think about this is a lot of people have asked me this question of okay now that Facebook has 500 million people or is nearing 500 million people before today um you know a lot of the job has become in addition to building things building out a team communicating externally now and kind of dealing with a lot of these different constituents that we wouldn t have had to deal with when we had 10 million people using our products You know those are the things that are typically you see in a mature company right And um and I think the way that we think about this is that if we thought that Facebook was a mature company and was anywhere near the end of its trajectory in terms of being able to innovate or that the product was near maturity in terms of its development if people were sharing on the order of the amount of information 00 20 00 that we think that they ll end up sharing then maybe those things would overwhelm how fun it was to build this But we just don t think we re anywhere near the beginning I mean instead what we I mean anywhere near the end What we ve seen is you know there s this massive trend on the internet toward there being all kinds of information available Right I mean when I was growing up I Google came out when I was in middle school Right and and laughter so I mean search engines It s like growing up And like every year there there was like some new cool thing Right so um it s like one year it s all right there s a search engine now you can look for anything you want or another year it s like all right now there s Wikipedia you can like get reference material on anything you want Now there s Napster you can get any song you want Right and it s like all these different services But the thing I think is most interesting to people is other people So I think it makes sense in a way that Facebook is by far the most engaging app that s been built on line to date I mean people who use Facebook spend much more time with Facebook per person than any other app So we did for the first few years of building the company from 2004 to 2007 was with really a small group of people we just started building versions of products that were designed from the ground up to be built around people right We built things like photos and groups and event and what we found was you know each of these projects was built with a group of two or three people right because at the time the company was 20 or 50 people or 20 to 50 people in that range and so when we built this photos application that don t have a lot of the features of other photos applications right There were no high resolution photos you couldn t print I mean early on you couldn t even reorder the photos in an album but what it had was it was built from the ground up so that as soon as you shared a photo all your friends had it And it turned out that that feature was more important than every other feature combined  David Tagging of people was the key   And the same thing for groups and the same thing for events So what we have now is Facebook photos are used I think three 00 22 00 four or five times more than all other photo services on the internet combined right and a similar story for groups and a similar story for events So then we hit this turning point in 2007 where we said Okay we think that we can take basically any application and by building it to be around people which are the thing that people care the most about If we just if we if we if we did that then we think we can build a more engaging version of any application out there Because there s so many applications that need to get built rather than trying to build these all ourselves with teams of two or three people where we re not building all the features that whole companies could let s build a development platform right That s what we ve been focused on since then What we ve seen since then is just in the most recent release right we built this thing called social pluggins where um where you can just any site can take a line of HTML copy and paste it and drop it into their site For example CNN com already has this you can look at any news article and you can see which of your friends like that article without CNN ever knowing who you are or who your friends are It s a really cool experience What sites that have used these social plugins have seen is that the engagement that they ve gotten from people using Facebook has gone up by about 2x the referrals from Facebook And that s just a simple integration Um so you can imagine that people are doing a lot of deeper things are getting even stronger results right And the first one that I think we re really seeing of an industry getting completely transformed is games I think games are often an early indicator in a new platform We kind of saw that with the iPhone There were games that took off  David It used to be porn but okay go ahead   Fair I think early pc there were a lot of games Facebook games are really one of the first things that took off and there were all these companies there s Zynga there s Playfish there s Playdum Crowdstar a whole kind of new set of companies and I mean these are real companies Playfish was acquired for almost 400 million last year Zynga on the secondary private markets has a market cast that s 00 24 00 about half of that of EA with an eighth of the number of employees And that s disruption right So I think what we re going to see is so this is year one in terms of this industry is is kind of the first one that s getting transformed but I just think over the next few years we re going to see it in every industry  Guy Mm hmm   So that s exciting right So now back to your question about is it okay to spend some time interfacing with the media and governments and all that yeah if you get to do that So but  Guy David let me just talk sorry interject here for a moment   Guy is the moderator  Guy I want to get back Mark to this idea of the question that I asked and this idea of this immense data base And I don t mean to present it as some kind of nefarious thing that you re sitting atop but we know that Facebook has this incredible ability to say to an advertiser you want to target 26 year old women who like Bikram yoga and we can get you there which is amazing Now I trust you and you trusted you re currency and you re telling us to trust you and we do let s say but what happens in 10 years or 20 years or 30 years when you re not let s say in charge of the company or your power is altered in the company and somebody in the company decides to take that data about us the information that we have volunteered and handed over about our likes and dislikes the music we listen to our birthdates who we re married to what our kids names are and sell that information What kind of guarantee is there that that won t happen   Well I just think it would be the stupidest thing we could possibly do  Guy But so but  David  Cross talk 00 25 40 CEO or what I mean   For um no I mean the internet we re talking about how technology moves so quickly right And I think it s really easy to say that there s all this information that Facebook has or something like that But really what 00 26 00 Facebook is today is this engine and this community of people sharing a lot of information on a day to day basis  Guy Except that it s that information is in a centralized   Actually I think that that s maybe a misconception because the rate of information that people are sharing is increasing so quickly that the nature of any sort of exponential growth right is that the amount of content that people have in the system last year will be just a fraction of the content that s in the system at the end of this year It s going to keep on growing And not only are more people signing up to use the service because they want to stay connected with friends and family but every day that goes by each person on the service on average is sharing more information into the system Here s an analogy that I think is actually pretty apt for this Think about Wikipedia right Wikipedia has this policy where any person can go download all of Wikipedia and fork it and create a rival encyclopedia And you know some people have taken some Wikipedia content and tried to do that but no one ever creates anything that s anywhere comes near close to um to quality of Wikipedia The reason for that is because the real thing that Wikipedia is isn t an encyclopedia it s a community of people that build encyclopedia somewhere else but you re not copying the community Now Facebook is very similar because we have all these open APIs and we re building a platform like I was just talking about and people can go and they can take all there information anywhere else What Facebook is isn t a set of information today it s a community of people who are using Facebook to stay connected and share information They re only going to do that as long as they trust us and as long as we re the best tool that exists to do that  Guy So just to confirm if they were to decide to leave it that data would be wiped out You would no longer have that information   Yeah I mean people people can use the API they can take their information to all these other services Not only are we okay with that we re encouraging it That s the whole platform strategy that we re embarking on By allowing people to do that we re allowing much more innovation in other apps that we would never get around to building 00 28 00  Guy We know that that for many people is not a choice any longer because so many people have come to depend on Facebook it is not just a cultural phenomenon it is an indispensible part of many people s lives You describe Facebook as a utility like the electric company like the phone company Two question should it be reg why shouldn t be regulated like utility and if it is a utility couldn t you make the argument that it s a monopoly  David He doesn t mean that when he says utility But he should not use the word utility because everybody thinks what you think a lot   So when we talk  Guy I get you   Here s here s what we started off talking about You know  David He should stop using the word utility because utilities are regulated   When when when we got started everyone compared us to MySpace And the big difference we saw between ourselves and MySpace was that people used MySpace because it was cool and because it was fun And people as us this question all the time What s going to happen when Facebook is no longer cool Right it s been around for six years where things don t stay cool forever My answer to that question is that our goal was never to build something cool it was to build something useful right Something that s cool is not going to be around for a long time Something that s useful is around for a very long time potentially if it continues to be useful Um so to me when I say utility that s what I mean is that we re trying to provide people with a utility not to have something that s fun Um in terms of regulation I mean we get regulated by users right I mean  Guy Mm hmm And is that enough you think   I think like there s plenty of dialog around what we do and important issues that are going on on the internet I think we ve shown that we listen carefully to that and that influences our policies and the products that we make And like I was just saying we support this open platform and we want to design it so that people can go and they can take their information and go to any other service they want  Guy Mark in David s book you re quoted as saying Having two identities for your self is an example of a lack 00 30 00 of integrity which I think is an interesting quote And it goes on to explain that people shouldn t have a different persona present a different persona to their coworkers and present a different persona to their friends So say um you know I behave in a certain way around my family and behave a slightly different way around my coworkers you would argue that there s a lack of integrity there I m wondering why you think that is Do you think we should all interact in the exact same way with everybody we know   No I think that was just a sentence that I said Um laughter I mean that was like the wrong part of an argument  Guy That s a quote I was worried you were going to say that Oh geez laughter   No I mean what is the definition of integrity I think it it literally is being the same thing in different spaces  Guy Are you the same person right now that you are when you re with your friends for two years   I m not actually probably yeah I mean  Guy They re around   Same acquired person Um I think that that is the definition of integrity right Like the dictionary definition is having the same face not saying one thing to someone and saying a different thing to someone else So I think actually by definition um if you are presenting one face to another to one set of people and another to another that is a lack of integrity I wasn t making a value estimate on whether or not  David Perhaps it would help if you studied Greek Yes go on  Guy I mean the the the Janice Headright 00 31 22 but you do talk a lot about from this idea of I want to expose any transparency with both of you because I think it s fascinating I m interested in this idea of transparency because there s different ways of looking at David Brooks in the New York Times writes about this a lot He talks about transparency in government and how paradoxically it has created a climate where more more fewer Americans actually trust government The more transparent government is the fewer people trust it You really push this idea of openness and transparency um what do you think it will lead to Why do you think people should be willing   What do I think of what  Guy What do you think it will lead to Why do you think people should be willing 00 32 00 to reveal details about their lives open themselves up to the world I mean why not keep some things private and personal   Well I think people will always keep some things private I think there s a big difference between now and 20 or 30 years ago is now everyone at least has the tools if they want to to share things But a core tenant of Facebook has always been control From the very first version of the site we built privacy controls that every single piece of information that you put on the site You could say exactly who saw it Um and one of the challenges that we ve had is the company has grown is trying to make it so that scales because now people are sharing way more things than they were at the beginning and we want to make sure that they continue to have controls for each thing but we don t want to have a thousand different controls that they touch So so that s one of the big areas that we ve been modifying and innovating on recently It s just now you know there s just one master control you know you go to your privacy page you can say in a few clicks I want all the content I share on a day to day basis to be visible to only my friends That s what I want  Guy And clearly that was a response to the criticism and and and that has dissipated by and large Um   But going back to the question oh I m sorry You were going to ask a different question Go for it  Guy No please please   Control when people feel comfortable sharing information and they feel like they have control what they share and who they share it with people become comfortable sharing more things right So for example if I only can choose my mobile phone number with everyone on Facebook I wouldn t do it But because I can do it with only my friends I do it right So now there s more ability for me to actually share those things What I think that that creates over time is there are these opportunities for people to share more thing and I think a lot of people are realizing that hey it s really valuable for me to share more things in certain context And that leads to this kind of broader social change where I think now there s more transparency right I mean more people are blogging more people are using 00 34 00 Facebook to share more stuff more people are using Twitter more people are posting stuff on Youtube That means if we want there s more out there that we can go look at and research and understand what s going on with the people around us I just think that leads to broader kind of empathy understanding um just a lot of kind of good inaudible 00 34 16 human things that make society function better  Guy David a brief note a very interesting chapter on privacy in the book which I found very useful and did you want to say something about that  David Well I was going to say first of all I totally buy what Mark s said I mean the reason people put so much data on Facebook is because from day one it was the first place that ever existed on the internet that had privacy controls It was the only place anybody had ever put their real name and their cell phone number and their email address because they could control who saw their data I think one of the reasons this privacy issue is so fraught for Facebook and leads to so much discussion and controversy is because people have entrusted an enormous amount of data to it And I think they re worried that maybe their trust was misplaced This is where I think Guy s question before is a legitimate one about what would happen if you weren t in charge You know there is this huge mass of data in there But rather than have you answer that again I would like to ask you another question which is closely related and very related to what you just said My own personal feeling and I ve spent a lot of time talking to people about Facebook it s like all I ve been doing for the last six or eight weeks cause I ve been promoting my book I just came from Kansas City last night So why doesn t Facebook make it much much even easier than it is to set up group functionalities You can control like the family the best friends the high school friends the church friends the friends you just friended on Facebook because you couldn t say no laughter but each one each one of but each one of those is a different category for whom you want different visibility into you and you want to see different visibility into them It seems to me you would get more sharing if that functionality was radically improved 00 36 00 You ve got it It does exist   Yeah yeah no no you re right  David But it s not easy enough to use if people don t even know it s there So how do you deal with that You re going to improve that   We re going to do better We can do better Yeah this is one of the core areas that we need to work on now and we are working on Now people have all these different groups of friends and It used to be that saying I want to share with my friends was a good that that meant private Like I don t want to share with everyone I want to share with my friends But now I think more and more people have sub groups of friends that they want to be able to share different things with sub groups That I think is a really important case and we re cutting at it in a lot of different ways to get there And hopefully soon we ll have more to talk about  Guy To what extent To what extent does to what extent does the success of Facebook depend on the majority of users choosing the least restrictive setting privacy settings   I don t really think that that matters much I think the key is that people can share with whoever they want right And that people it goes back to the point I was making before with Wikipedia what we have is a community of people here who are this engine for sharing and connecting The key is that they can do that in whatever way that they want I think the question that you re talking about of being able to segment it into um and just saying here s my family here s my work friends here are my school friends here are my high school friends whatever it is um that would be really valuable to do But I think that that kind of gets to one of the core things in building Facebook is that designing products that do these things simply is pretty hard I think that s one of the big innovations that we ve had is I mean earlier on you guy like we were watching that video I mean we re not designing microprocessors but what we are doing is designing very simple ways for people to have social interactions that are very nuanced And um I think it s a lot easier in 00 38 00 a lot of these cases to point to what a problem is than to come up with what is a solution that people will actually use Um so let me give you an example of something that we did that actually didn t work that well Um our first cut at trying to help people segment stuff segment their friend list into groups was this functionality that we call friend list right It s basically you can go and you can create a list of people um and you can put whatever friends you want to whatever list you can say okay here are my high school friends here are my college friends here are my work friends whatever It turns out that most people don t want to go and create lists of thing Most people would not ever even have a friend list to begin with except for the fact that the act of creating friends is a very nice social interaction right You get to reach out to someone and say Hey I like you will you be my friend And the person can say like Yeah Right And I mean that s nice right There s this nice feeling that goes along with that Um and I think that that s why people do it People aren t on Facebook because they want to list their friends right So that s what designing the product is about right It s kind of coming up with these way that kind of align people what people are trying to do which is stay connected with building out this platform which is going to help them stay connected even more when you can do more things with it I think everyone agrees no doubt we would be in a better place and people would be able to share more if everyone magically had these sub groups created Um I think that there is a solution to it and we need to get there but it s hard and that s one of the big things that we re work on  David This is a passionate subject for Sean Parker as you know I mean he believes that you should every time you see a name on Facebook you should have an easy drop down menu and you should be able to put people into a group based on you know your groups inaudible 00 39 44 every time you see the name shove them into a different group change the group or whatever You know you said something before that I think is really interesting and I d like to just quickly I know it s kind of a dual interview here but anyway Um you said laughter it doesn t matter whether people use the everyone privacy 00 40 00 setting that much right You made this change in December where you sort of forcibly caused people to use the everyone privacy setting and it led to a lot of controversy and you undid that later Are you saying that when you undid it you didn t regret it and feel like oh we sort of lost the ability to do things I wanted to do I mean I personally was not happy that I had always had my friends list friends only and you undid that Now you ve given me the ability to go back to the way I like it But how important was it to you to try to make it the way that you tried to make it   So honestly a lot of what we were trying to do was just create a very simple experience right We don t want to have a million different setting that people have to touch because if they do then they won t Then they won t use the system because then they don t feel like they can control their stuff We tried to create a simple a simple set um a simple system for them based on the settings that we actually saw that people were using And we made some mistakes and we got it wrong And it turns out that even if only 1 of users use a setting they really care about that setting laughter and so it s fine right That s our job is to try and balance that We make a lot of these tradeoffs I hope more often than not we get them right Sometimes we make mistakes We always listen We try to um to make sure that when people have feedback that we take that into account And when it s real user feedback right not not just something s that are getting kind of a lot of attention But I think the reason why we made a lot of the changes is because we look at how people use the site The site has evolved a lot over time It started off as this college thing right I built the first version when I was in my dorm room at Harvard The way that the site worked early on was you shared with the people around you and your college community and your friends So it s always had this element of it was your friends but it was also the people around you like cause I mean you wanted to share with maybe 00 42 00 the people who were in your classes at school or maybe the people who you were in a club with who weren t your friends yet right and that was really valuable Now as we got out of college and more people started signing up we found that there weren t as good proxies in society as a college for like the social circle that surrounded your whole community So we tried other things like the city around you right And that worked pretty well but then we were growing so quickly that what happened was we couldn t actually keep up and we couldn t actually provision a city for each geographic area So what we ended up with especially early on when we didn t have a lot of international growth was we had these kind of crazy situations where a whole country would be a network right So Germany was a network India was one network China was a network  Guy Everyone of those countries could have effectively see everybody s info   Yeah exactly Now the interesting thing is that those users were more engaged on the site than people who could only see and communicate with the people around them in college So in the US we almost had this completely different experience right Where a lot of us have these college networks we have work networks or we have networks for our companies and that s been our experience It s been a lot tighter and we enjoy that even though ironically it s led us to use the site less on average whereas internationally where at now 70 of our users are outside of the US they are actually getting a huge amount of value out of sharing in that way and having those be the setting So we decided okay well going forward for new users let s do something that s more like that When we got feedback that people wanted to make sure that they could tweak it more easily um if they weren t happy with those setting then we kind of holed up in a room for a few weeks and we built that Or we built this one control where now you go to your privacy page where there s just one control and um you know you can click twice and have all your content set to friends and you re good But we really listened at what people used how people used the site because people are 00 44 00 the site So we listen to what people when they write into us but we also listen to what their actually doing and we look at the data of how people are using the site and we try to make informed decisions on that  Guy Um Mark let me move away from the privacy issue for a moment We still have a lot of questions for you and I m sure there s a lot of questions out there as well I want to ask you about Apple And I want to ask you about how much of an impact Apple had on how you are thinking about calibrating your product As you re aware many people are using Facebook on mobile devices increasingly myself included You cannot right now for example upload a video you take with your iPhone directly to Facebook Um as more and more people start to use Facebook on mobile devices particularly Apple devices will you start to alter your product to accommodate those users   Well I think in a way we already do I mean we have an iPhone app which is specific to the iPhone which more than 50 of people who have iPhones have  Guy But the thing I m talking about for example uploading video I mean obviously Apple has this issue I think is an understatement with Adobe laughter how do you sort of what do you do about that   We do the best we can laughter  Guy You stay diplomatic   I mean there s it s a great platform right And a lot of people like using it Actually it is an interesting challenge developing things today because in 2004 when I got started with Facebook it was very clear what we were going to build we were going to build a website We weren t building desktop software We weren t building something for a phone Desktop software was the past phones were too far off into the future and not a mature enough platform yet Build something for the web Today I think it s it s it s there are all these opportunities and challenges because 00 46 00 you have a web version you have a iPhone version you have an Android version you have an iPad version you have a mobile web version for phones that have touch interfaces you have a mobile web version for cheaper feature phones which don t have um which don t have like rich and browsing interfaces and it actually ends up being really challenging to develop for all these environment but it reaches a lot of people You know it s how people want to use the service so we we spend a lot of time doing it  Guy In a recent article in the New York Time Megill Health 00 46 33 wrote an article that said Google regards Facebook as its biggest threat today Do you think that you threaten Google   It s interesting that people talk about that so much because if you think about it on its face we don t do any of the same product right I mean like they do search we don t to search they have email we don t do email we have mass they do more direct response advertising and we do more brand advertising so even that is quite different So I don t know I think there s one perspective on Google which is that Google s market cap is greater than that of all other internet companies put together so from that perspective they could see any growing company as a threat But from our perspective they don t have to lose for us to win More people are using Facebook everyday and that doesn t mean that people are using Google less right So what we re trying to do is just make it so people can stay connected with their friends and the people around them better That s just not a service that anyone else currently provides we think it s important so we re going to try and do it as best as we can  David I just wanted to make a point on the Apple issue You know the Facebook app is so central to the success of the iPhone that if Facebook were to determine that the way that Apple was handling video was truly problematic for Facebook in my opinion they would have more leverage than anybody 00 48 00 probably on the planet to argue for a change in the way that it s handled I firmly believe the iPhone would not have become nearly the phenomenon that it is and I have one If the Facebook app wasn t on it It s a huge percentage of total application use on the iPhone I m sure if any us heard the number which is a highly closely held secret it would be astonishing how high of percentage of usage it is So Mark is not enthralled with Steve s job is what I m saying I think Facebook has extensive leverage if it needs to exercise it I doubt if Mark would confirm his opinion on that but that s my opinion And I do know isn t it true you re spending a lot of you ve gotten to know Jobs pretty well recently haven t you Haven t you spent some time talking to him lately   And he s great  David I think he s spent a fair amount of time talking to him laughter   No I wouldn t say a fair amount I spend all my time building product But um you know  Guy What do you make of um  David There s that Ambassadorial responsibility coming up again laughter  Guy Speaking of competitor or potential competitors what do you make of these groups of people who are working on open source um social networks like Facebook where data would not be central would not be stored in a central location Diaspora for example you ve got to be aware of this   I ve donated money to them  Guy There you go Reading David s book it reminded me and reading about how you guys created Facebook it seems like there s a lot of that kind of energy in Diaspora A Does it worry you But Does it remind you of yourself three or four five years ago   You know I think it s cool Early on in Facebook we had this project wire hog that I think you actually cover a bit in your book  David Just a bit yes   I don t know I actually haven t read the book  David He doesn t like he s not laughter   I don t read stuff often  David Are you going to watch the movie though   Probably not  David That s what I thought  Guy We ll get there we ll get there 00 50 00   So early on you know so we talked about a little before about how photos ended up being such an important part of the Facebook eco system From early on our users were requesting that we add more photos to the site and ready or not we had no money right And hosting photos is expensive Um so we figured okay let s build a decentralized um application that can plug into Facebook that s a web server it looks a lot like what these guys are doing where people can host their own photos wouldn t that be great right Um and I think it just turned out at least in our implementation We couldn t get it to work as well as we wanted And it turned out that us hosting the photos application and running that our selves was a much better solution once we had the resources to be able to do that But I just think it s cool that all these people are trying all these different things right I mean I think some things some technical systems become decentralized some become centralized right I think we can all probably agree that it would be pretty bad if the search index were split on to 10 different sites and you had to search in a lot of different places I mean that s a service that I think makes a lot of sense to have centralized Um but are you okay  David Yeah yeah I m fine   All right Um and so I don t know I just think it s cool to see what all these people are doing right People are building great apps the use the social graph through Facebook like games and all these other applications people are building other kind of alternative structures to mapping out the graph that I think are cool innovations um it s all cool  Guy Um Mark in the spirit of openness and transparency that obviously you um I do have to ask you some questions that you probably don t want to talk about But there is a Facebook fan page 5000 users have signed up to this fan page for a film called the Social Network It has a Facebook page You know that it is a  David I have more than that for my book laughter   There you go  Guy We all know that this is a um telling um we ll just say a kind 00 52 00 of telling or an imagined telling of um well imagined history of Facebook first thing do you plan to see the film   I mean probably not Generally I don t read stuff or watch stuff  Guy I just asked you Do you I mean do you have any anxiety about it coming out Do you have any worries or concerns Is it annoying   You know honestly I wish that when people tried to do journalism or write stuff about Facebook that they at least tried to get it right Um so I mean that s why having not read all of your book I ve read a part of it when you sent it to me um I at least appreciate the effort that you put in in terms of spending all those hours and days talking to dozens of people um in the eco system around us at least trying to understand what s going on right If I had read your book I probably wouldn t have agreed with everything right But at least there s a sense of serious journalism right And at the same time I mean there s another book that was written about us that was written by a fiction writer and these guys were um decided to have this idea right let s make a movie about Facebook Um and they seen they had a few choices of books to base it on We ll just base it on the fiction book  Guy Just in his   You know what I mean  Guy Just in his defense he did try to interview you for his book   Um the reason why we didn t participate is because it was very clear that it was fiction from the beginning When we talked to him about that And he basically told us I m most interest in telling the most interesting story We want to make sure that we re never that we never participate in something like that so then someone can take something that s really fictional and say and we talked to  for this Right So um I think it s clear that it s fiction All the book reviews of that 00 54 00 book um from people who know it say that it s fiction The movie is based on the book I don t really know how much else there is to say about it  Guy Do you wish that Justin Timberlake was playing your character laughter   That really would not make a difference one way or another You know the guy who was playing me his cousin works at Facebook  Guy Oh really  David And he still has a job right   He is currently the lead designer on newsfeed and I meet with him every week to go through the next version of what we re building I mean he s a cool guy and he s really talented Um you know I m sure all the people involved in the movie are talented right So that s cool but I mean the movies fiction and I think that s really the most important thing that we have  Guy And you ll just sort of let it go and hopefully it will pass   Yeah I mean I really believe that all that we can do is focus on building the best thing and that over time people will remember us for what we build right and not what anyone said about us along the way And um maybe that s idealistic and maybe I have to think that but that s what I chose to focus on right And what I want to keep the company focused on But I think that that means you know you can t just say that I want to ignore things that sound bad or that that are kind of made up about us I think it s really important if you re going to have that perspective that you also don t pay too much attention when people are saying really good things about you either We have a really strong sense of the company of what we re trying to do and that s what guides us  Guy Do you sometimes wish you could drop out and escape for a moment and get away from the inevitable celebrity that comes with being who you are and what you created Do you sometimes just think God I just wish is could like shut it off for a day or two days or a week   Well I mean I can it s called hanging out with my friends at home or at their homes  Guy You can t you d be recognized anywhere here   Not in my house laughter I mean you can t come to my house 00 56 00 laughter I mean a lot of my friends now my closest friends are people who I ve known throughout the whole experience or people who I ve gotten to know by working with them really closely over the past few years right I mean as an example of one piece of fiction in the movie I think they somehow try to portray it as if I m building Facebook to get girls Laughter  Guy Somehow that s like the whole theme of the movie and the book   I haven t read the book and whatever The truth is I ve been dating the same girl since before I built Facebook right So um like a lot of the people who have been through the story have been consistent throughout It s that core group of people who work on it who care about it who are your friends who are really the important people and that s what matters  David Also wait it s not it s a much bigger issue for Facebook it s the issue of how media books movies change the image of  and the company is a far smaller issue for them in my opinion than what governments and regulators are going to be saying and doing And this is why I think this issue of you know do you really want to be out there meeting with David Cameron every week like you did the other day That s what you re gonna have to be doing because whether you like it or not I don t think the movie really matters in the grand scheme of things from a stand point of Facebook s success or failure I do think when you are maintaining all this identity information for people and you re getting into areas where governments feel very threatened and this issue of privacy is of such great concern in so many jurisdictions this is a real issue I think the movie is something of a distraction and I honestly would like to hear more about how you think you re going to handle this issue We ve seen it with the privacy regu the commissioner of Canada you guys negotiated with them for a full year and then she got mad again after you did the recent stuff And the EU is coming 00 58 00 at you and the Australian government s coming at you and and This is a real I must think about that don t you   Yeah I think that there important dialogs to have And you know there are all these folks that we work with We obviously mostly listen to what our users want both in terms of what they do and what they tell us We work with a whole set of nonprofit organizations who are the voice of users on privacy issue and security issue and things like that and we interface with governments What I find more often than not is that all of these people are reasonable They all are doing what they re doing because they think it s good for the world No one is coming at us with bad intentions I think the key is just to engage with all these people who are trying to have this real discourse around serious issues and try to come to the right issues The internet isn t stopping  Guy Are you personally willing to engage in that to the degree I think it s going to be necessary for the CEO of Facebook whether it s you or somebody else to spend a very substantial percentage of their time doing that I wonder whether you want to do that I mean Larry and Sergey hired Eric Schmitt This is like the question people ask me all the time Are you going to hire that kind of a person because you really are a product guy you know I don t know whether you I ve heard you did a great job with Cameron by the way and the whole cabinet that s very cool Maybe that is what you re going to want to do more of and I m not saying that you can t succeed at convincing them of a lot of things you re talking about up here but there are enormous misconceptions abroad about Facebook s reality and intentions and when you are operating in literally in every country on the planet except for North Korea China Cuba and a few others you re going to have these issues day in and day out   I think the strategy is as 01 00 00 follows I mean we have a great team of people who are just top notch in this field We hire the best engineers and product folks we also hire great policy thinker because a big part of what we re doing is shaping internet policy right and how that plays out over time through our product right And like I said we re not the last chapter in this The internet will not stop right The internet is going to keep on going These issues are going to be important issues We want to make sure that we engage with the people who are having this debate to make sure that everyone gets to the right place I think that the great people that we have on our team are actually going to be able to do a lot of it Now in terms of these companies I don t know if the model of hiring a CEO to be externally facing while the people who are making a lot of the decisions aren t that person is really a viable model I mean this technology company is really our product companies and a lot of the most important decision I think all of the most important decisions come down to what you re offering to the people that you serve who are your users in the end right And I think that s the most important thing right So we need to make sure that we handle all these things as part of a team And that s why we spend a lot of time just trying to get the most talented folks on all of these different realms to join us But I think for the long term I think it gets back to what I was saying before about how I don t we re anywhere near the end of developing the platform The platform decisions we make the product decisions the technology decisions we make are going to be the most important decisions we make over the next five or 10 years I think that s what the roles are  Guy Um in um it the book David describes a leather bound notebook that you started carrying around in 2005 you used to scrawl notes in it Um as 01 02 00 far back as 2005 you laid out your vision for the newsfeed for opening registration to everyone opening Facebook up to apps by outside developers All of those things happened Um what s in your book today Or if you re not keeping a book anymore  David He might be He probably is  Guy What are you thinking about what s swirling around in your head   I think I ve talked about a lot of it But I mean the platform stuff I think is it s just there s so much more to do  Guy What should users of Facebook expect to see in the coming years There s actually a good question here that ties into this I mean will we be able to make phone calls or do two way video chats or get CNN video for example 24 7 is that a possibility   I don t know if the goal is to get that inside Facebook com right I think what people should expect over the next five years is that virtually every important service that you use online but eventually off line too are going to get remade and designed from the bottom up with people at their center That might happen from inaudible 01 03 11 leading incumbents into the spaces or it might happen through disruption from new entrepreneurs who are structurally have more of an incentive to take risks and just will overturn things like we re seeing with games now But I think that that s what s going to be exciting We have a lot of work that we need to do um to make sure that we build out that kind of plumbing properly right And that we build all the products on Facebook well enough to handle all of the different types of information that people are going to want to share and that are going to be flowing through the system But if we can do that then you can imagine the world is going to look a lot different Everything from how we get new which won t necessarily be on Facebook but maybe the CNN of the future or the New York Times of the future just looks a lot more social Instead of just getting the pick that are from editors 01 04 00 you get picks from the people who you trust the most and who have similar interests and the whole news paper s personalize to the things that you ve said that you re interested in You know we ve already seen experiences were you can go to internet radio on Pandora and it just automatically starts playing the songs that you like without you having to do anything cause it s personalized You can turn if off if you don t want that experience but it s a great experience  Guy Um we of course in our business know that there are major consequences for that as well   And they re going to be good laughter  Guy We hope so I m going to turn to some question form some more questions  David I was going to say you know there is no question that what he s saying should be listened to by anybody who s concerned about the future of Facebook Facebook s goal and strategy is not to be a website long term They are very consistent about it Mark and his engineering and product people all say the same thing The platform is Facebook s future And that s basically what he s saying It won t happen inside the confines of Facebook com Facebook is aiming to be a set of services that are applicable to people no matter what they do It really will extend beyond the internet itself It s going to be on your web on your phone or your mobile device you re going to carry with you and you re going to apply it to increasingly everything you do if he gets what he s trying to build you know implemented That s   You know I think that if we don t succeed at building it someone else will I think I just think that this is likely the way that things are going to go If for no other reason that we ve seen that every single app that has been built and designed with this methodology of build and design around people is significantly more engaging and grows faster than all the other types of apps that haven t Right now it doesn t mean you can do it poorly and have it work but whenever there are good entrepreneurs whether it s folks who work at Facebook on photos or groups or events or folks 01 06 00 who are tackling games now or people who are working on ecommerce stuff in the future when people hit that it s going to work And um we can be the platform that provides that I think we re certainly in the lead now but we re not near the end right So there s a lot of room for innovation left and we need to keep on moving in that direction if we want to help support this  Guy Mark I got to get to some of these questions cause there s some very good ones here Here s one I like it s um the question is as CEO when was the last time you actually wrote code   For Facebook or not laughter  Guy Well why don t you answer that cross talk 01 06 43  David Your not developing another product again are you   No no I mean all the time for fun I think it s really important that you use your own product right So for example I use Facebook com all the time I use the mobile versions all right I have an iPhone and I have an Android phone because I think it s important to use all these different things If you want to build a platform you also have to be a user of that That means writing code So on the weekends sometimes I do Um the most recent time that I checked in code for Facebook com um was actually for the platform as well Leading up to F8 which was in the late April this year that s our annual developer event the platform team which was kind of sitting there and they had this big monitor on the wall with the number of bugs that they had left to fix um and it was like 150 three nights before and everyone was pulling all nighters constantly it was like alright I ve already written my keynote um I ll help out I figure that s pretty good for moral right I mean you get like that people and then Schroepfer joined in our head of engineering and um we just kind of sat there and we fixed some bugs and we wrote tests to make sure it was going to be stable when it launched and it was fun right 01 08 00 And it felt so good because so much of the infrastructure of what we do requires having good code and good abstractions that actually being in there and being able to see the work that people are doing on a day to day basis um just gives us a much clearer sense of kind of the investments that we need to be making to run the company better to build better products in the long term  Guy What are the issues or things that keep you up at night   The main thing is just that it just kind of gets back to the theme of there s so much more to do and I mean we re just this little company right We have 1500 people now  Guy Little company worth 27 billion   Well you know I mean who cares I measure it in terms of  Guy Your investors do   I measure it in terms of the number of the number of people who are working on it right And there are 400 engineers at the company and right now about 150 really excited interns who are writing code Um but that s it There s no other organization on the face of the earth that has 500 million people that it s serving with 400 people writing code for that Um so I think the biggest question when you look at the eco system and you come to the conclusion that I have that we are not near the end right We are not in maintenance mode Um there s a lot more innovation there are a lot more people I mean 500 million people may be using the service today but I think that this is something that over time everyone is going to want to use I mean everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected with those people So we have a lot more work that we need to do to get it there um the question is how do we get there right And are we moving fast enough how can we move faster We do all these things and we try to be bold and we try to move quickly but I actually think the biggest challenge might be maybe how can we move even faster  Guy Because you see other people creeping up   I mean not it s just that the opportunity 01 10 00 is so big right I mean I think if we if we fail then inevitably that will happen but I think that there are companies that their primary dynamic that they re primarily limited by competition right And they re in more of a zero sum market where their win directly means someone else s loss I don t see that much with us I mean I think that there are competitors and that s important And we want to look out and see what good things other people are doing so that we can learn from them but it s not zero sum I mean there are a couple years ago there were many fewer people using Facebook now there are a lot more In a few years there will be a lot more people using social networks It s our job to make sure that we build the best one so it s Facebook that they re using And um but the segment is growing the behavior in the world is growing I just want to make sure that we do our best and kind of getting the world there  Guy In David s book he describes um sort of the evolution of how you dealt with being the CEO being 22 and now 26 and working with people older than you Your COO obviously at least 14 years older than you Um what in your opinion this is a question from the audience makes a successful entrepreneur Why are some people why did you become a successful entrepreneur rather than others who had great ideas who had some success but then failed What do you think you did different and are you still learning how to be a CEO   Well I think they re actually two different things being an entrepreneur and being a CEO I ve spent a lot of time thinking about this because obviously it s a very important thing for me to reflect on and talking to the folks around me what I really think it comes down to are two key things for building something well 01 12 00 One is just having a really strong sense of what you want to do right Because along the way there are so many distractions that if you re not completely clear on what you want to do you re going to get sidetracked I was watching this interview with Steve Jobs once where he was basically an entrepreneur asking for advice it s like what would you say to me um as an entrepreneur and the advice was make sure that you really love and care about what you re doing because if you don t it s so irrational the amount of time and energy that you have to put in to building what you re going to build that it s just not worth doing and you re going to fall off at some point along the way So I think that s number one It s kind of being clear of what you want to do and really caring about it Number two is building a good team right And like that s what I spend a huge amount of time on and when I m not building products and I don t even really build products anymore I work with teams who build products it goes all the way down the organization from a really good head of engineering who can scale out and really get the perspective the best packers and engineers and people who want to build stuff to a head of product who can really communicate exactly what you re going to do to make sure that every person in your company knows exactly what the plan is um to really good business folks like Cheryl who keep in mind any of these people could run the company Um I mean it s to the question before about like should I be running the company or not If I were to disappear any of them could run the company I just think that that s a really important thing when you re trying to build something You need to you to get great people around you right So but I think that if you ve got a clear idea of what you re doing and you have great people then you re that s a lot of the battle  David The scope of the vision that he had from the beginning was quite extraordinary I think that in case was a secret sauce element but it s really interesting 01 14 00 that he has been able to hire people from the time from getting Sean Parker you know all the way through to Cheryl and all the amazing senior leaders that he has now who really share the vision I mean the scope of the vision to begin with was very very very big and he s done an amazingly good job at finding people who are good at all sorts of sub segments of the task who also share the scope of the vision That s kind of if I were a if you could mimic that you re going to have a successful company  Guy And do you still do you still sort of study how to be a CEO I mean do you think about what you need to do and what you need to learn to do that job   Yeah I mean I started this when I was 19 and I knew nothing So I mean when I moved out here I was so lucky in terms of just happening to meet the right people who could help us with the simplest things about building a company Um meeting venture capitalists who have seed investments so you don t have to keep on spending all of your college tuition doing a contract to set up a data center I mean I took computer science classes none of them were on how to set up a data center So um so yeah we ve made probably every mistake that you can make like as a company and yeah I think that if the plan plays out right and if the next five years are as exciting as the last five or six have been then there are going to be a lot of hard decisions to make and we d better spend a lot time thinking about how to get those right We re going to get a lot of those wrong and we d better learn from that Um so yeah yeah  Guy I like this question 01 16 00 um it say you are always asked the same questions in every interview about privacy and data are there any questions that you wished people would ask you What would you wish that I asked you or that David asked you   Yeah I mean there s this odd dynamic in these interviews where the stuff that I m most excited about in any point in time is what we re building now and I can t talk about it laughter  Guy What about openness and transparency Right   We can talk about the future um I think yeah I think we ve touched on a lot of those topics Um I don t know Maybe I don t spend enough time thinking about that because I m too busy answering the questions that I don t want laughter  Guy But it is part of the price you pay for pursuing openness and transparency which I think is a good thing but at the same time there s responsibility that come with the pursuit of those ideas right Fair enough isn t it   Are you talking about just doing interviews and things like that  Guy Yeah   Yeah I mean it s definitely important I think as the company is scaled to make sure that all the people who use our service everyday which I mean is actually perhaps one of the most amazing statistics about Facebook I mean we talk about we just reached 500 million are using Facebook We ve always had this crazy stat that more than 50 of our users use the site every day  David It s still true   Still true yeah Um we figured it would as we got into people using computers less that would stop being true but it hasn t Actually in the last year the percent has gone up which I guess means were doing a good job  David What is the percentage   Um it varies I don t want to give a specific number but you can say it s a little more than 50 use it every day 01 18 00 Um  David Where do you see the largest growth potential by the way   Well I mean there are different countries So for awhile our strategy was just kind of see where it grew We had no targeted marketing or anything like that And really that s an interesting thing about Facebook too we don t do broadcasts right we re not trying to market ourselves The way that the site grows is because people tell their friends that they should be on it and then they get their friends on it So the whole marketing for the service is um us basically giving people the tools that they need to get the people that they want onto the site Um so we never until very recently targeted a specific country as a place that we wanted to grow in And we started off in colleges and from very early on we just basically took request I mean people emailed in and said Okay launch it at this college And then when we had servers early on I mean I was renting servers for 85 a month Um we d put ads up when we had enough money we rented more servers when we had more enough servers to have more capacity we basically stack rank the colleges that wanted to get on Facebook and um by the number of requests that people had sent us and we opened it up to those colleges first When we made it so that anyone could sign up we built a tool so that users themselves could translate the service So basically we had this thing where we opened it up and within two weeks all of our users had submitted and voted on all these translation to translate every single string of text of which there are 10s of thousands into Spanish and then we opened up to French and they translated in one day I guess they re really passionate about their language laughter and that s kind of how it grew You know people who wanted in their country 01 20 00 um did the effort to get it in their country Now it s only recently that we re doing more targeted things and the reason for that is that we ran out of countries Um we um there are really there are a couple of countries where we aren t yet the leader but I think the trajectory is pretty clear that we will be like Brazil India we just passed the previous leader there There are really are only four countries that we re not the leading social network service in it s Japan Russia Korea South Korea and China So we re focused on that now This year we re focused on Japan and Russia we have three engineers who are like All right we ve never done anything like this we want to just get parachuted in to Japan and we want to just rent an apartment and code and go rogue And we re like all right go for it And they re working on that And in Japan I think we re already more than a million people and they ve been there for six or nine months So that s going pretty well so that s one area for growth There s the countries that we haven t yet yet really gotten into But the other one is just making it so that everyone uses the service We ve seen countries get up to as much as 80 of the internet population on Facebook The theory is that it really is a universal service Basically everyone has friends and family and they want to stay connected with those people Whereas the people ask us these questions all the time of how do people use it differently in different countries how do people use it differently at different ages And the thing that s crazy isn t how people use it differently It s how similarly they all use it Um so I mean there are differences differences here and there I mean there are different applications that people use in different countries but by and large it s really similar and I think that that s why something like this will end up being extremely universal There are countries where we re at 80 of the internet population are on 01 22 00 Facebook and their countries like the US where I think we re around 130 million people are using it and there s a lot more to grow I think it s just going to be really interesting over the next few years and this is one of the challenges at the company that s really fun is we get to build product both for countries where there are no users yet and for countries where a huge amount of people are on the service and the real challenge is getting people who barely use their computer to be able to ramp up and wire up in a social network  Guy Mark last summer the state department reportedly asked Twitter to delay a routine maintenance outage and the was during the Iranian street protest the demonstrations against the re election of President of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad if the government asked Facebook to do the same to allow people to have access to a site where they can post information and videos and other material would you honor that request   I think it depends on what it is exactly We ve never had that exact situation that they were in I ve had other ones but um it is really interesting because some of the most interesting use cases that we ve seen um have been of people using Facebook for political purposes right So there s this example I think you cover in the forward of your book Oscar Morales  David Oh yeah that s the cross talk 01 23 31   Um and um basically in Columbia there is the FARC right and a lot of people in the country are really opposed to that group But I guess the group has a massive amount of control over media and there was never before Facebook an outlet for people to organize or to express their concern about it This one guy was pretty 01 24 00 brave and he went out there and he made a group and it was pretty easy to do and he started spreading it and before long um what was  David Ten million people in the streets one month later   Yeah 10 million people all cities across the world protesting FARC and FARC had recently taken hostages and there were a lot of other things going on around the time so I don t think that he really claimed credit for this but I think that this was one of the things that put pressure on that organization to release the hostages which they ended up doing And I think things like that large scale political movements are pretty interesting to see play out in this new medium It s all this stuff its Youtube it s Twitter it s Facebook and all this other stuff that s going to get built on top of these social platforms going forward But I don t know it s one of the really gratifying things about building this and we get to be just a part of kind of empowering people to do those things that they couldn t do before  David I think one of the most interesting things about Facebook is attention that it s in so many countries literally every country pretty much and so many of those countries are not truly free and democratic and yet the governments let the internet operate and let Facebook operate and the tension is developing in a number of countries which I consider extremely healthy which Facebook is playing a very prominent role in you know it s countries like Egypt where it s been playing out very dramatically just in recent week but you see it in different ways in Indonesia in Bangladesh even certainly Venezuela Columbia you know it s really really interesting that a I must say Facebook is a platform for the empowerment of its members One of the things that I think people don t appreciate about the difference between Facebook and Twitter is that people get on Twitter to be broadcaster right but people get on Facebook to say let s meet at the mall right But once 01 26 00 they get on Facebook to meet at the mall they happen to have acquired a broadcast platform that when they get upset about something political they have at their disposal So ordinary people find themselves in control of this political tool at the very moment when they need it and it is not something a lot of governments are going to be that comfortable about going forward And I think that s great  Guy Where do you draw the line Mark as you know in Pakistan for some time the government blocked Facebook There was a page set up by somebody it was called submit your cartoons of Mohamed um I mean are you ever worried that you might be sort of targeted by some group that feels well you know you re in charge of this company and you haven t shut it down   Well actually I think someone is trying to get me sentenced to death in Pakistan now laughter that s not a joke laughter I mean it might be funny but it s not a joke I mean this is where I think you were asking before what you have to do to build something like this and you have to really believe in what you re doing right We think that what we re doing is a really valuable thing in the world and I hope I don t get killed  Guy Obviously there are restrictions on pornography how do you sort of decide I mean I know there s a policy how do you sort of decide what skirts the line and what doesn t   You know one of the approaches that we take I think that there are a lot of countries company sorry that um that now we re serving a very international user base but really espouse American values 01 28 00 right And to a point where I think it s almost um almost closed minded right How much they only have American values and write off the values of the other countries And you know I think with our user base and the community of people that are using Facebook we really have as a goal to be an international company We have 70 of people who are using Facebook outside of the US And like you were saying different countries have different standers for what hate speech is right So for example in the US we have one standard in Germany it s illegal to post anything with Nazi content it s a law it s in law you can t post anything with Nazi content That s a decision that they made because they felt that it was very sensitive after World War II Our stance is that we respect that if it s a law Different countries have different stances on what hate speech is right Now if Germany came to us and said Don t allow Nazi content anywhere around the world That would be ridiculous Some people have there have been blog posts written about this why does Facebook allow holocaust denial and things like that especially when the person running the company is Jewish and it s like because we believe in free speech Um so that s why we do that But we also don t want to take and American centric approach to it right So um where we get where we really um where we think that we draw the line is when a country has a clear standard that s written into law it isn t just being arbitrarily enacted by the country but I feel that these are some of the really interesting questions that have to get resolved over time 01 30 00 Um but I think that s for this next wave of companies I mean there s so many more people outside of the US than inside the US I think you wanna have that global perspective right Look we believe in certain things like we believe in certain things We believe that openness and transparency and free speech are good and that giving people the tools to share things are generally going to be valuable all over the world but we also believe that you should respect other cultures I don t know That s our take  Guy Last question Mark before we have to wrap up um on paper of course we all know that you are a billionaire you re a wealth guy or you have the potential to be if you sold the company and you had opportunities Where do you see yourself in 20 years and beyond with your name on buildings or public philanthropy following in the footsteps of Bill Gates um running a different company even living here in Silicon Valley   It s funny to think about I don t know how many of you guy are know Kevin Rose he s the founder and CEO of Dig and he once had this awesome quote you know there s this story on the front page of Business Week how this kid made 80 million or 60 million in two years and I was like okay this is ridiculous this is a private company um I don t have any money Um he does this podcast or this sorry this weekly video where he sits on a couch with another guy and they talk about whatever the biggest issues are that are facing Dig Someone asked him what he thought of that piece and it s funny I m not a millionaire I m not even a thousandire laughter I had to borrow money to buy the couch that we re sitting on laughter so you know I don t know in terms of that really I don t think it affects me  David I did once hear Mark ask Jim Pryor for a raise because he was moving into a bigger place   So the most important thing to me and this is maybe 01 32 00 kind of a funny story is I just want to live within walking distance of our office right It s California it s beautiful I want to be able to walk to work Um and we moved offices from downtown Palo to University Ave to California Ave to get a bigger building so we could have everyone in one place and we had to so we moved to this new place And I just wanted a new apartment that was within walking distance of the office So you know so my assistant was looking for an apartment for weeks and weeks and weeks and finally I was out traveling somewhere and I get this phone call and she calls me and goes all right I found an apartment I m renting it I m sorry I found a small house I m renting it So I literally I hadn t even seen the house before I moved in um because like I don t care like I don t spend any time there I m at the office the whole time right I was like well what I want to be able to do is be able to walk home at the end of the day sleep and then go back to the office laughter so I don t know that s me that s me And I was like  Guy And in 20 years from now Bill Gates philanthropy   I think we ll see I think we ll see Like I I really care about what we re doing I think there s a lot more to do I think this trend towards people sharing more towards the world becoming more open and transparent is I think one of the most transformative things in society over the next 10 or 15 years maybe longer who knows but that s what we re focused on um there s a lot more to do it s really exciting  Guy  David Kirkpatrick thank you applause  Guy That was good applause   Thank you applause 01 33 53 '}\n",

start looking at it and assume that this was the direction you set out to go the whole time Take us back to the dorm room at Harvard Talk about the initial idea and what the initial idea looked like relative to where you are today   Well so my sophomore year at Harvard when I first built this there were a lot of really interesting stuff going on I mean there were two primary things that were happening kind of at the same time The first was like any college student I just spent a lot of time hanging out with my friends while people were studying Computer Science Psychology the things that I studied and other stuff And we just spent a lot of time of talking about what we thought were the big issues with the world And how the world was gonna change over the next five ten twenty years And you know a lot of cool stuff has come out of college conversations like that in the past And for us what we discussed was that the biggest trend that was going on right now was that more and more information was becoming available All right so going back to kind of the start of the internet and mainstream when browsers were available and since then people have just been sharing more and more information and a lot of that was still being shared by a small number of companies or content producers But that over time people would be sharing more and more information themselves and how that happened was a really important thing All right so people care a lot about controlling information about themselves their reputation their privacy And there was just kind of that big question about whether the world would evolve in this way that people would have control over that themselves or if that information would just be available And so that s kind of on the one hand We spent like all this time discussing that and on then on the other hand I just built this little thing So we kinda had those conversations at the back of my head but what I was building was this application for Harvard students Six thousand people to share some information about themselves and stay connected with their friends and family And what we basically just found since then is that that application is something that almost everyone wants to use Everyone has an identity that they want to express and friends and family that they wanna stay connected with And it has grown from that original six thousand person student body to more than and friends and family that they wanna stay connected with And it has grown from that original six thousand person student body to more than 250 million people across the world And the cool irony in it is now we ve actually had an opportunity to shape how that first sort of big trend that my friends and I discussed five years ago about more information being available and people having more control over the information We ve now been able to shape up a bit how that plays out So it s been a really fun part of this  Blodget And so go back I remember my sophomore year we definitely had those kind of conversations and I m glad you had them in your satellite a lot more philosophically helpful to the world than otherwise what I remember having been imagined So where did this idea to build the application come from I mean were you setting out to build a company Was it Hey I can build this cool little technology thing that people can log into I mean where did that motivation come from   Well there are a couple of things I mean I didn t want to build a company Well I actually explicitly did not want to build a company It wasn t even that I kind of wasn t thinking about building a company And that is why early on where most people would probably launch it at schools that they thought it would have the highest chance working What I did was I launched it at the schools that I thought would have the lowest chance of working So those were schools that already have some kind of school community And the reason why I did that was because I wanted to know early on if this was something that was just worth spending a lot of time on as a project You know in college I just built whole lot of different things And that s just a passion of mine It s kind of building things very quickly Yeah the first person on Facebook I built in 2 weeks and then we improved the application and when it worked and spread extremely quickly to these other colleges that already had something similar to it that people are using We figured Okay this is something that may be could grow to be a lot bigger And that s what when my roommates joined me and we really started growing it aggressively  Blodget If you listen to people talk about Entrepreneurship and Innovation there s always this tremendous focus on the idea Is it the idea that is sacred and is the person who thought of it the one that should get full credit for it and so forth From what you re saying it sounds like the concept of hooking people up on Facebook and so forth was already out there So what was it that enabled your version of it to take off where everybody else was stuck   Well I think it s just a combination of execution and an idea of where you want it to go So from those conversions that I had with my friends in college we had this very broad idea of where we thought the world should go and not just kind of guide at Facebook s development to this date But a lot of it was also just good technical decisions getting really smart people in to work on it Some of the smartest people that I ve known were a lot of the original people involved in Facebook and a lot of them are still here I mean people who were my teachers in school people who were my classmates The people who I thought were the smartest around and I think that s a lot of what gets it to where it s gonna go  Blodget And so you in the beginning you didn t want to form a company In fact you went out of your way to not make it that You wanted to control the world What made that change   Well eventually what I realized once we started getting a bunch of really smart people together that a company is really  Blodget These were during your sophomore years   Yeah I mean it started off with my roommates and a few other people It occurred to me that building a company was the best way to align a group of people towards building something great And it s really it s a good organizational structure where you can really reward people If they re building something that s good you can you work with partners and reward them if the product that you re developing work well It s a good way to get the best people involved to build something very good  Blodget And where did you think of that I mean again I ll take myself back to sophomore years and I may have been retarded in a lot of ways so what is the idea of building a company comes from Sophomore year in college Were people suggesting it to you I mean on the outside did you always have these bugging entrepreneurial fantasies and where does it come from   Well I mean so I build the first version of Facebook in a couple of weeks It was was pretty quick especially for the scale that it eventually was offering I mean I started at just I rented a server for 85 a month And on that we were basically doing I think millions of page views a day Because we have I think at some point like 10 or 20 percent of all Harvard students were logged in at the same time This was just in the first week So I mean so there was a lot of stuff that went into building the first version But that was pretty quick And that has expanded I just got more and more smart people around me to join Eventually we moved out to California Originally when we went out there we weren t expecting to move out there we wanted to go out there for the summer because we had this feeling like Okay all these great companies come from Silicon Valley Wouldn t it be cool to spend the summer out there and get that experience But we expected to go back to Harvard in the fall and the thing that made it so that that we didn t was that Harvard has this great policy that lets you take as much time off as you want So we decided Okay let s go ahead and take one semester off and continue just building things out And more people joined our team and at that point we formally incorporated the company and got our investment from our first investor Peter Thiel And then things were just growing and we got up to a million users on our first year of running the site And then we decided Okay let s take a second term off from Harvard And then you know just things kept on growing and we got up to about 5 million users and we were like Okay let s take a whole year off And then like All right I guess we re not really going back But I mean it was never this big decision where it s like Okay at this point I am going to drop out of school and then I m gonna start a company and it s gonna be this crazy thing It just happened very gradually and at each step we were just kind of doing what made sense to do next  Blodget Its sounds like in talking to a lot of entrepreneurs it sounds like that s actually relatively similar occurrence to what xx The grain of an idea that really takes hold especially on the internet You see this all the time If you think about a small product takes off suddenly it becomes something huge Did you think that that s helpful way to think about innovation do you feel like some people when they say Okay I m gonna start a company there s way too much planning ahead of time get the business plan perfect get the products perfect I mean this sounds like a much more organic way of doing it   Well one of the great things about the internet and about how quickly information close now is these markets are very efficient Right so with more traditional businesses it would take often years of investment before you hit some kind of curve where you knew whether you re thing was going to work Now it s possible to build something in a weekend or you know two weeks as the first version of Facebook worked And just launch something and see if it addresses the market or that they re really use And from there you can kind of get real time feedback and adjust what you re doing very quickly But it s possible for a site to get for example 250 million users like we have in five years which is extremely quick Things like that just couldn t happen like generations ago right So I think that that just leads to a different kind of development now  Blodget And I mean going back it sounds like the decision to drop out wasn t a one time thing It was keep going from there Were your parents supportive of this Again you re a sophomore   When I talked to my mom after the fact She tells me that as soon as I went out to California for that summer she knew I was going to drop out So as soon as I went out to California for that summer she knew I was going to drop out So I guess yeah they are supportive  Blodget And how important as you look back on Facebook s success or history how important was coming to the Valley I mean if you d stayed in Cambridge for example and done it   You know there are companies that do both I mean some of the best companies are not built in the Valley I mean I really admire both Amazon and Microsoft which are companies based in Seattle You know for us I think it was really valuable because I was 19 when I started thisThere was just so much that I didn t know There still is and Silicon Valley is just a great place to meet a lot of great engineers there s a lot of infrastructure built up to help support just getting companies off the ground Whether it s the investment community or the legal community or just all these different areas Undoubtedly that helped us In terms of designing our first data center Just all of these different things So I think for us that was a pretty valuable thing Although I think it can work both ways  Blodget When you look at the model of successful technology entrepreneurs You ve obviously decided that you want to run the company Why is that   Well in just my view of looking through the technology industry and its history I think the companies that have done who have often been led by their founders or at least extremely early in place of the company And I think that that s because often those people have the better sense of why the company was created have a lot of creditability within the company in order make the decisions that need to be made The world changes so quickly so being able to guide the company efficiently I think is an extremely important part of that Someone showed me an interesting stat once that that out of public companies ones that were still run by their founders out performed others And I think that that would be an interesting thing to look into I don t know you know obviously that s probably someone can dispute that or question what it means But I think that the model of having the person who is guiding the direction of the company run the company Well being surrounded by a group of really talented people who are effectively managing the company and running its different areas is a very good model No matter what the model is it s really important to keep in mind that it s never just one person So in our case we have just a handful of really great executives you know whether it s folks like Sheryl Sandberg who is our Chief Operating Officer or Mike Schroepfer our head of Engineering who joined us from Mozilla or Chris Cox our head of product who started off as an engineer at Facebook and has built some of the most innovative products here and is now our head of products You know it s really it s always a team of folks and and even more than those that I mentioned who really are running the place  Blodget Right and I talked to Mark Hendrickson who in his new venture capital firm actually has an interesting statement that he s looking for founders who want to be CEO s Again certainly in my experience it s often the VCs come in and they try to find a way to push the founder out gracefully and then install professional management so it s very interesting to see that and so forth But you started you re nineteen you come out here you got big fast You didn t have this long period where you can make mistakes quietly or what have you and it sounds like   No we make mistakes loudly  Blodget Exactly that s right and you do have great people around there s no question There s some decisions that are just going to come right down to you Do I sell the company Are we going to roll this product Are we going to pull back this product And it seems to me that requires just a lot of self confidence and where does that come from I mean how are you confident in your decisions You re leading thousands of people These decisions make a very big difference to you and your users and your company and your shareholders   Well I mean even in the decisions I make I seek the input of the people around me and the opinion is shaped by just all the smart people that we have And it s not just the management team I mean it goes all the way throughout the company All the folks that we have here contribute a lot to the strategy and a lot of the ideas that we have But I mean I think a lot of it is it goes back to what we were talking right before It s just how the company got started We we started this because we thought that this was one of most important trends in this generation it was making it so that as the world became more open That that could happen in a way that was good for people And that they could control their information and be empowered by this and have a voice as opposed to other ways that it could play out and that s always been my for compass for running the company and you know the decisions that we ve made whether they seem controversial or not Some of them are Some of them you know weren t internally A lot of them were just guided by that compass  Blodget And you look back not based on what you knew Not based on everything s 20 20 hindsight obviously There are there things with the experience that you have now that you would have done differently So for entrepreneur coming up right out of school running around a company gets big fast What would your advice for that person be as you look back   Oh I mean there are so many things that I would have done differently I mean in general it s just that you make a lot of mistakes and those are valuable mistakes We re better off for having made most of those but I also think that we ve done a good job of staying true to do who the company is and what we started off to do And we ve also made a lot of very good technical and product decisions along the way and good cultural decisions to make sure that we can make it so the best people can come and work here And have a very big impact very quickly I think that those are the most important things And if you get those right then you can actually make a lot of mistakes Actually one of the core values of Facebook is is Move fast And we used to write this down by saying Move fast and break things And the idea was unless you are breaking some stuff you are not moving fast enough I think that s still basically true I mean right now we ve optimized so much of our culture around just making it so that people can come and build things quickly Right whether it s everything from having the right tools in the right development environment to build things quickly to nightly code pushes hiring the best people who have a bias towards just pushing things very quickly very entrepreneurial The whole culture is tuned around that And I think there s probably something in that for other entrepreneurs to learn which is that making mistakes is okay At the end of the day the goal of building something is to build something not to not make mistakes Right so in order to get any reasonable conclusion you re going to make missteps along the way And as long as you learn from them and those become valuable in getting to where you want to go then then I think that s fine  Blodget And how do you build up a skin thick enough I mean you have been through already just huge craze huge criticism of every decision you make second guessing all that stuff You probably get more advice than anyone ever should get in a lifetime most of which is probably BS How do you sort through that and just sort of say Look I know I am young I get it but I m going to trust my gut I got good people around me I m going to make the decision How do you basically tune it out which is what any successful leader has to do   Well I think a lot of it is you have to kind of stay grounded with what you re trying to do A lot of it is just what you just said right I wanna listen to the people around me as opposed to what you know a lot of people outside who know less about what our business is doing and what our goals are and kind of have their own opinions on how stuff should work What would they think about things and I think that that one of the tings that we ve always done very well here is we have a strong sense of purpose as a company You know we didn t start Facebook to build a website or even start Facebook to build a company We started this because we wanted to make the world more open and connected Building a site is the first step towards that 250 million users is a start I think You know I mean I think over time a lot more people will be using it And I think over time a lot more people would be using it beyond a website I mean I think that the platform that we re developing at Facebook connect are some of the things that I m most excited about And we have almost a million developers right now who are building things ranging from small you know just groups of people building things in college getting started like I did to small businesses to large businesses that have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that are primarily built on top of Facebook platform And um I mean that s really exciting And I think a lot of that just comes from staying grounded having very good people around who share what you re trying to do And for us it s like we have very strong sense of purpose in the culture  Blodget So Facebook has this tremendously vocal user base Anytime you make a change people scream It doesn t matter what it is And the years that I ve been watching the company you watch news feeds huge screaming you stuck with it   A million people that s screaming  Blodget Screaming and you stuck with it and it s been now one of the core attributes of the company that everybody talks about Beacon came out big announcement lots of people screamed That one you backed off on And said Okay we ll do it differently or we ll revisit it or what have you How do you make these decisions and what accounts for the difference there   Well one of the interesting things is just the volume of the feedback that we get and I think that that s a testament to what we re trying to do as a company We re trying to give everyone that voice Right and make it so that people who wouldn t have necessarily otherwise had a venue for communicating or sharing that information about what they think now have that So you know when we look at that when we see the feedback I mean part of us is just Okay its working It s working well You know but then a lot of it is we really listen to what people are saying and then we think about Okay this is where it is today we know where we want to go in the future What if their feedback is going to be very valuable in helping us build the best product for the long term And in which pieces do we think that over time they ll get used to Or you know when I say they ll get used to I think a lot of it is because we re building this network right Where something may end up you know one thing that users ask for a lot for example is they want like just different designs on their pages  Blodget Right   And we ve routinely said No to that because we just think it s actually better for everyone if the pages stays clean right So we make a lot of decisions that optimize for the network as opposed to what a specific user is asking for that given point in time So news feeders are an example of something where I think it just changed some of the social norms People put up information they work strutting to share it with people newsfeed completely respected all the privacy settings and it made it so that the information was easier to get access to for the people that you decide to share something with So if I decide to put a photo album up and said that you can see it Then that will just go to you a lot more easily And that was different from what people expected but we figured it was a more efficient way for the system to work  Blodget So they freaked out but in that case you said Whoa it s going to work out just watch it get used to it Maybe you gave them little ways to take them with it you stuck with it On Beacon you didn t you said You know what you re right I went a little too far let s change it And so your users sort of say You know what that s actually a good point    Yeah Well I think that you know there s Beacon there are lots of examples where we ve gotten feedback from users on large projects and little ones as well that have changed our decisions That s one of the great things about the internet is you can launch something and immediately get feedback and immediately react and build something good and launch it the next week Right Which just wouldn t have been possible with more traditional businesses But yeah I mean one of the things through all these though one of the things that we talk about a lot is giving users control over their information This is a really fundamental thing on Facebook because you know the more control people have the more comfortable they are of sharing things Right I can I ll put up a photo album from my vacation because I know that I can share it with exactly the people that I want I can control those privacy settings But even more importantly I can take it down if I don t want it to be up anymore And on a lot of the rest of the web you don t have that flexibility You don t have that kind of control and that s one of the things that drives all the sharing that exists here One of the things that s interesting is we talk about this constantly and we realize that it s a very important thing A lot of the times when we get feedback from users it s just to remind us of how important that is to them So I m gonna round news feed or beacon or just any of these different things A lot of or beacon or just any of these different things A lot of the message that we got from users was we want even more control You know so that s just a big part of what we spend our time developing on it s constantly adding features that give people control of their information in different ways and we know and we kind of have this formula that we give people control they are comfortable sharing more that makes the site more valuable and just becomes a better product for everyone and then more people use it And that is just the huge part of what we do  Blodget And do you re used to this for now so when you come to launching and you have a big new feature and what have you you know there s going to be screaming You get the screaming you then have sort of a war room meeting to evaluate the screaming and say Well this is something that we should think of   Well we like to think we re getting a little bit better at this you know The interesting thing is that it s such a different scale at which these products launch So when we launched news feed we had only 10 million users which is pretty hard to imagine given that it was only 2 and half years ago and now have 250 million users I mean this scale is so much different now than it was back then So if we launch something now we will get a lot of feedback but it s a much smaller percent of the user base And I think that a lot of that is because we re getting better at communicating with users understanding the ways in which they want control over the information Building them in when we launch products or in a lot of cases even before we launch products just continually launching things that are giving more control in helping them share information in different ways that either they want And um I don t know I guess I would hope that over time the trend is that we have fewer of these As a preset see  Blodget You talked a lot about how important the culture is getting the right people the big company Elsewhere in the valley of Google that has made huge to do about 20 percent time The developers have had time to dream and think of their products projects and so forth What do you think about that Do you have 20 percent time here   Well we do things a bit differently We have a culture that is very focused on being very focused on what we re building Focus is a really important part of it  Blodget Wasn t it Google for a long time It seems to be in vogue so they may be saying you know the focus is better but   So but at some time we want to make sure that everyone can come and add their ideas I mean some of the best ideas throughout the company s evolution they have just been from just places all throughout the company whether it s an engineer or someone on the customer support team or just different areas around the company So we ve always had these hackathons that are basically time that we allocate that the only rule is that you don t work on what you work on the rest of the time It s basically an incubator for people to prototype different ideas much in the spirit of how Facebook got founded originally You can build anything good in a day or a couple of days right and get version of that running  Blodget So you get it running you then test it internally   Yeah and then we can see That helps us shape the road map in what we want to do in the future But we also have a culture where we want to stay very focused and we don t want to run with a lot of projects that we don t expect to launch So we want to get a lot of ideas help those ideas shape to where we wanna go and execute in a very focused way on the stuff that we re gonna do But I mean our culture I mean we have a few values that are really important to us One which I talked about before is just moving fast The whole company is really optimized around someone joining being able to build something very quickly be able to launch it quickly iterate very quickly on that Get feedback quickly That moving fast ethos is a huge part of what we do And another big part of it which we kinda talked about is just this idea of wanting to be bold in writing the decisions that we make And we have this belief that you never build something great by doing the same way that other people have done it So there are a lot of things that there are best practices around but for the core things that we wanna do when we have the decision to either do it the same way that someone else has done it or do it in a different way we re gonna choose to do it in a different way And we really encourage people all throughout the company to think about things in that way and make bolder decisions  Blodget But it s think about it come up with ideas execute it in very small form and then we ll decide as a company whether we re gonna go for it It s not everybody has their own pet project that they re working on and we re going to have 78 different products in beta and we ll see what works and and so forth   Well I mean we encourage people to build things in their free time as well Right And I think that that s a lot of what Google has done with their program So we have that all the time People here are just building stuff like night and day And there are venues where people can experiment with that publicly or privately inside the company There are a lot of different things going on One of the big advantages that I think we have as a smaller company is just focus We ve a very focused mission I mean what we want to do is make it so that people can share more information and control their information and can stay connected with the people they care about And those are kind of two core use cases of the product and almost everything about what we were doing is focused on optimizing those 2 things  Blodget Great So you re five years into your career as a founder and entrepreneur of this massive global organization which is amazing but we ll leave that aside so what do you think the three keys to Facebook s success at innovating have been thus far if you had to really narrow it down to three   Well I mean I think it s a lot of the cultural values that we ve talked about so far So I mean I think making it so that it s the place where people can move quickly it s just key having an emphasis on making bold decisions and and being bold in the products that we build I think it s why we have products like news feed which at a time was controversial but now is one of the core part of the product and has been emulated by a lot of other start ups and companies Worldwide we have platform When we built our first version of the development platform I mean people weren t thinking about social networks as social platforms for social software development And that was a pretty controversial decision and we decided to go for it now we have a development in community of you know almost a million developers So that is kind of a direct by product of that kind of line of thinking And then I think just also focusing on leverage and impact you know the best people want to go to the place where they can have the biggest impact And we have always focused on this ratio here of the number of engineers that we have to the size of the user base for the impact that they re gonna have And what we found is that you know each engineer here is roughly responsible for more than a million users if you do the calculations that s much more than the smaller companies that have smaller user bases within a smaller employee basis And much larger than larger companies that have maybe more users but also a lot more employees So we re kind of in this sweet spot and we ve always focused on building the company in a way where there is just a lot of leverage and that that would encourage just the best people to come join the company  Blodget And so speak personally and talk about the three keys to your own success I mean there have been again you re wonderful at attributing the success to everybody else Which is great and they deserve it and appreciate it and so forth On the other hand you ve taken this thing of going after an opportunity that thousands of people have gone after and you are the one who has led this company to be the world dominant player in this right now There are a million ways you could have screwed up So what do you think the three keys to your success are   Well I think a lot of it goes back to those values And the values often come from the founder or the person running the company So I think I believe those things probably the most strongly of the the values often come from the founder or the person running the company So I think I believe those things probably the most strongly of the people at the company  Blodget Move fast   Yeah move fast be bold Focus on impact And I think you know I think long term focus is a really important part of this and we ve had a lot of opportunities to optimize for the shorter term whether it s in selling the company or doing in different products that would have benefited us in the short term but not optimized for the long term impact I just think opportunities like this don t come around that often So when you get one I feel like you almost have a duty to see it through and built it to be what it can be  Blodget Thanks Mark '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2010-023', 'content': ' Speaker 1 So we re going to do some Q A and then we ll open it up to the audience and someone thought keep us on track with time over there Um so as you know I like to talk about to the early days of when you start up   Yeah  Speaker 1  what have started So I remember you told us last year that when you first started Facebook you were just building a cool project   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1  that you would use So what point do you did you start thinking about Facebook as a business And like do you remember that   Yeah  Speaker 1  moment   Yeah yeah yeah You know it s funny I thought we weren t going to have to cover the early stuff because there was just a movie I mean but that that was a laughing a 100 accurate and characterizing all the old stuff up um I don t know I mean I start building this because I like building stuff All right so um when I was in college and and even before that in high school I m so and D Angelo was up here a few ago talking right We went to high school together We built all the stuff together And and when I went to college I just built a lot of stuff by myself and most of the stuff have this property that I built it for myself right So there was a music player or just different tools that are that are built to make my computer work more the way that I wanted to Um I never have to make something that was going to be used by other people Um so Facebook was different because you know that and a couple of other tools and things that I started building when I was in college that had this property that in order for to really work I mean get people from sharing information with each other other people had to use them So I started building products and thinking about consumer products in that way But like the whole time I ve really spent focused on building this because I think it s a good thing to do and it s fascinating Um I guess my philosophy towards business had evolved a bit Where earlier on I I m just like really didn t think Facebook was going to was going to be a business I didn t um care about starting it as a business I wanted to do it because I thought that was a really interesting and valuable thing to be building And um 00 02 00 now I guess my attitude is that I think that building a company is one of the most efficient ways in the world that you can kind of align the incentives of a lot of smart people um towards making a change Right so our goal still on a daily basis is not to make as much money as possible I mean run the company around break even right because my view is um at least for the next few years for stable future I think any money that we re making we might as well just invest in something that is either going to make users lives better developers lives better um or some of our business partners lives better Um but there s no real point right now in my coming some massive profit right now this got some kind of an extension of how I thought a bit early on It was not thinking as making a profit early on Um now I think making it so you can align all these people s economic incentives right employees business partners developers advertisers Making a few concrete values for them is the thing that powers this whole system and makes it that you can build this awesome um engine of people sharing stuff So I don t know that s how I think about it now  Speaker 1 Okay So back to when you got started Um what if you could do something differently from a technical standpoint what would it be and what was the coolest technical hack that Facebook ever pulled off   Um so there s a really good one but I can t talk about it yet because we re audience laughing oh we have this hackathon So every few months it s like one of the traditions that we have at the company and it s um like an engineer they re completely um just organized organically If it s an engineer well we ll send an email that are like All right we re going to have a hackathon on this day and the only rules if you can t work on what you work on the rest of the time so ends up being this huge breeding ground for future new ideas And um some mobile stuff that is really interesting that the people are going to packing on it and making so that um making it so that people can build social applications across all platforms Ah it s it s 00 04 00 a big challenge there everything s are so segmented And in fact when when I was getting started building Facebook it was really like no question about what platform you re going to build on All right the um most people weren t building desktops off anymore the mobile platforms were in to evolve yet So it was very fierce like we re going to build the web thing right And now it s just it s so complicated What I mean people build web stuff you build there s mobile web Right there s versions that support touch there s simpler versions for mobile on on cheaper phones there s iPhone apps a Blackberry apps Android apps If you want to build an app and direct into a social network you build that Um building stuff that can seem mostly kind of integrate across all those I think it s going to be a a pretty interesting thing So that that s like some that s one of the cool things I think will be coming up soon Um in terms of the biggest mistakes that we made technically um I think it s how we architected the first version of the platform Um in 2006 we started working on uh the developer facing version of of Facebook s that people can build uh like you can build social apps that like go inside Facebook And I think we just got it completely inverted right And I think we re actually still paying the cost of this years later Um and that the interface that developers had towards building with us was this mark up that we called FB email at that time and it was all about um developers putting some kind of visual representation or some visual mark up on a person s profile page or um canvas pages and it was not at all about the social graph or the data behind it that there s connections that people had So you have these applications like um uh one of my friend s book was causes application How many of you guys know about this Since basically it s this way that you can raise awareness and raise money for different phone traffic causes And the basically the way it works is that they built in this canvas up and it works inside Facebook and they have tens of millions of users and it s working pretty well Um but fundamentally if you re connected to a cause that s not stored in the same kind of social graphic stores the rest of 00 06 00 our connections Right so you got to like search for a cause and type ahead it s not there Right you want to see a news feed story that that s shows that five of your friends doing the same cause it s not there Um and I think like that cause like in fact we architected that wrong upfront and made it s kind of this all but this visual mark up then made it that we had to go change all the stuff and thrash a bunch of developers which I think we re still kind of paying the cost of now in terms of trying to make the platform very stable um and in a place to where a lot of people want to invest So obviously it s not like it s not killing us So then we have I mean there s like a million developers that are they re something building on top of the platforms That s gone pretty well but um but it s taken us years to get to that point So I think just being careful about how you architect the stuff upfront is very important  Speaker 1 And that when you re starting Facebook you re just dealing with like the web right What do you think is are the new challenges of people starting web apps now   Yeah I ve I mean I it was so simple to build a web app back then What I mean the the browsers were a lot less different than like like right now it s have makes and work in every browsers very difficult Um and if if you re building a complex JSF uh but if the same time there s like obvious different mobile platforms so right if you want to build like an iPhone version Android version Blackberry iPad that s kind of complicated Um so I think that it s just one of the fundamental things about experiences that people are building now is that like your users will experience them in a lot of different places Right so maybe they ll use it on the web that they want to take it with them and use whatever mobile phone they re using Um one great way to spread your application is to do a social network integration because with that does is can expose activity that you re users are are are taking um to people who are not yet using your app right through their friends and other contacts Um so I think that that s going to be a pretty big trend for the next like five years It s not building an app in one place but building what we can internally views 00 08 00 like multi headed apps right it s like if you build something and people experience that in all these different places Um so making it so you can build ones and kind of having a lot of these in different places I think it s going to be very valuable Uh but in terms of thinking about building your own start ups I I would definitely think about the advantages of building in all of these different places where like web is very easy Mobile makes it so you can take it with you anywhere you go and building inside a social network makes it so you get so much more exposure to all these different users who are not uh yet using your stuff  Speaker 1 Cool So Ron call while you re talking earlier and needs to showcasing some of those successful entrepreneurs he knows and he said that when he first met you he was struck by the fact that you said We re going to have 300 million users someday Where did you come up with that number And how are you sure about that   I have no idea audience laughing Everyone s got a dream right Um I don t know Ron is amazing laughing and clapping  Speaker 1 Well if you don t remember   Yeah No I I I honestly I don t remember Um I mean it gets like when you re talking to someone like that you want to put on your kind of your best version of what you think could happen Laughter  Speaker 1 I m gliding out to the bottom of that Um so back you re at Harvard you re building this this um this program and you have the summer off   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1 And decide to come out to California like did you plan to stay and what was it like Was it um exhilarating being out here   Um so the game plan was just to come out for the summer to hang out Where it s so I d I was in the school freshman year and I actually stayed in Cambridge um between the summer of freshman and sophomore years And by the end of sophomore years like All right like I want to go somewhere different this summer and 00 10 00 um and I d been out over winter break just to visit a friend who went to Stanford and I was like All right this is so cool I m sure I remember like the first time that I was driving down from SFO to Stanford I m on 101 you like pass all these companies and I said Whoa this is awesome It is like you don t get that in New York suburbs towards here up Um and I remember thinking I want to spend some time out here so I can learn from these companies and I remember explicitly the time being like may be one day I ll build a start up and I want to move out here But like at that time well I was just like Okay I want to go out there for the summer because this is the fun thing to do and this was still in the project phase of Facebook And I started a bunch of my roommates came out with me and we were we were hanging out and it s a pretty fun summer But then you know we realized that it was it was really difficult to scale Facebook from kind of getting it started to I think it was around maybe 30 000 users by the time that we finished sophomore year And another time I was taking like um operating systems and um algorithms and like just a bunch of like pretty difficult CS process so scaling Facebook and taking that the same was fairly challenging And I I just remember this conversation that we all had around our dining room table that I was like Okay we re standing up a data center out here um we are going to go into the school year with a 150 000 users and hopefully um grow a lot more Can we really handle a full course load Probably not so let s take one term off Right and that was the game plan we re like All right we ll take a term off And then we took a term off then we really didn t hire anyone We basically still uh we went to the house and we all going to hang out in that house coded for a while Uh we did start talking to Peter Thiel and raised money from him but we re very clear that we want share for them to stay out here what we re going to do And you know we re just getting well and it kept on growing and we decided to take another term off And then 00 12 00 we decided to take a year off and then it s basically like Alright I guess we re not coming back laughter but um but there is never like some master plan or anything like that All right so I didn t realize we did that underscores that if you just like work on stuff that you like and you re passionate about it then if it s going well you can like you don t have to have some master plan for helping it play out What I mean is the conversation that you re just referencing with Ron Conway I think is interesting because I mean that was like my wildest dream it s like Maybe one day this thing could reach like 300 million users But the thing that s interesting is how soon the long term is Right because I mean I don t know when I met Ron Conway but I mean it couldn t have been more than four years ago Right so the fact that it s like the world change that much in that period of time And now you know like I bet when we have that conversation I don t I don t remember it s just hard for this to say but definitely but like I would have guessed that probably 300 million and was like decades Now they aren t like something really long right So I think if you just stay with something that you liked and you don t have to like find everything out of front If you just kind of keep on going and getting to the next level  Speaker 1 Where are your parents gone Maybe you want talk on that   This is so after I after I decided that I ve kind of was highly unlikely that I was going to go back I um I remember this conversation I was with my younger sister and my parents and um and my mom was like Actually I knew that you were going to drop out of college and I was like Thanks mom Laughter I fact I I didn t expect my mom to say that But before I started in college my younger sister made a bet with me that she would finish college before me laughter So she I owe her 50 laughter  Speaker 1 Okay two more questions and then we ll open it up to the audience Um so Ron also asked the audience how many of you have seen the Social Network and most people have So I haven t seen it but I want to ask you if this if that s the picture that that people have in their head about what happened at Facebook what s the real difference What is 00 14 00 the biggest difference about what actually happened   Where do you want to start laughter  Speaker 1 One of the biggest one   I mean I don t know It s interesting what stuff they focused on getting right Like every single shirt and tweeds that I had in that movie is actually a shirt or tweeds that I own laughter but clapping um but you know so there s stuff that they got it wrong and a bunch of random details that they got right The thing that I think is actually most dramatically interesting that they got wrong is the whole frame in the movie kind of the way it started I m with this girl who doesn t exist in real life um who dumps me um which has happened in real life a lot laughter um as um and and basically the frame is if the whole reason for making Facebook and building something was because I wanted to get girls they re wanting to get into some kind of social institution Um and I mean that the reality for people who know me is I ve been dating the same girl since before I started Facebook so obviously that s that s not a part it So I think it s just it s such a big disconnect from I think the way that people make movies think about what we do in Silicon Valley building stuff Where it s like they just can t wrap their head around the ideas that someone might build something because they like building things Laughter and clapping  Speaker 1 All right last question about college you took psychology courses in college right And   Yeah I was actually yeah  Speaker 1 And I want to know what what s something that that you re learning in your psych class that that was useful on building Facebook   Well yeah The biggest thing that I took away from the psychology classes that I took were how little we know about how the human brain works I mean 00 16 00 literally it s like I I think that our understanding of the brain is kind of like if you opened up a computer and we re like Oh when you re typing this command and this part gets warm but like so it s interesting Like I think um like I mean it s like you you read these studies were it s like Oh they like some guy got a steel rod put through his head and like this function stopped and it s like Okay like we understand nothing right Um so so there are all these things that that people say and I think like AI is a really interesting field right And one of the things that that s really interesting as um as technologies getting better is we re able to build computer systems that can help people think right So now I think that the best solutions to a large cluster of problems are ones where humans do the thinking that they re best at And we can get computers to do the thinking that computers are tuned for right In terms of uh just really kind of uh large scale computation determine a spec um linear and things like that Um where was I going with this So uh the thing is so there s this whole movement in the Valley right around is to go okay processors are getting so much faster right If we re going to continue going at this rate for um for just maybe 10 or 20 more years and we re going to get computers that are smarter than humans right And you know I don t buy it And the reason why I don t is not because I don t think computers are going to be as fast as people think it s because I don t think that we have a good understanding of how the brain works yet So I think that the human brain is probably or there s a magnitude more powerful than we think yet And it s just it s really interesting to design software that um takes into account the things that we do know about the brain in psychology So for example humans are so much more interesting to people than anything else Right um there is there are whole parts of the brain that are just uh totally tuned towards processing um like emotions Um there s a whole part of 00 18 00 the visual cortex that s tone that s tuned towards processing facial expressions right Like our ability to understand and process someone s face is so much more of rich than our ability to look at like a podium and differentiate it from other podiums Or if you think about it the facial expressions that people make are like so micro but mean such different thing is depending on if you move your eyebrows a millimeter in one of two directions And um I don t know I think that that s something that we often overlook in designing products And that that s one of the things that I m just really interested And with Facebook is I think people are still interesting to other people um if you can build a product where people can go and learn about the people around them and share information and stay connected with people then um that s something that s super important to people And I don t know I guess it s kind of it s probably the most thing that I took away but in terms of like real lessons I mean I don t know there s a lot more that we need to learn about brain  Speaker 1 Okay Well let s open up to questions and you can take questions and if you don t mind repeating them You can you can inaudible 00 19 03   Oh I have to  Speaker 1 Oh I ll do it I ll do it Okay   Oh I m happy to I just thought like  Speaker 1 Yes   I don t want that responsibility  Speaker 1 I ll do it Laughter   So why did I decide to move Facebook from Cambridge to the Valley Um so I really it wasn t a conscious thing right I mean it s what I ve talking out before where I moved out here for the summer and figured I d go back to school It ended up working out hugely well for us and you know I think that if I were to start a company today I m not sure if I would start it in the Valley I think that there s pros and cons But going back to where I was then and I was 19 I knew nothing right I I knew nothing about starting companies right And nothing about investment nothing about um legal stuff and nothing about renting a data center nothing at renting an office nothing at hiring Like I have roommates 00 20 00 that I was lucky that they are very smart Um and one of the best things about Silicon Valley is it s such a dense environment in terms of it s like instant start up mix right It s like everything that you could possibly need to think about starting a company there s all these resources here There is like very sophisticated people to fund your companies very sophisticated legal practices set up to help you set up your companies Um for the first couple of years we had an outsource accounting firm at Facebook where I mean they were all specialized towards helping start ups get off the ground setting up payroll and stuff like that I don t know anything about that Um so I don t know I guess like knowing what I know now um maybe you know maybe there are advantages to starting in a place that um I mean there are just advantages to Silicon Valley too So I I think it s like somewhat insular and um I think in some way very short term focused that are like I think a lot of blogs and things focused on kind of what s happening this week as if it s never going to change um I mean the world changes very quickly But I don t know unbalanced I think like it s really an amazing place And I don t know it it makes it so that people who have education and training and in passion to do something can have very little experience meeting up to that and can still build something pretty great in like five or six years And it s like there s nothing else like this  Speaker 1 Robert go ahead   Well if I told you then it would be very difficult for you not to expect it Laughter  Speaker 1 All right I m going to take a question over there Laughter 00 22 00   Um so the question is about for trying to make the world more open how do we do that in countries like China Um you know it s interesting I western companies haven t typically had this huge amount of success in in a few of the eastern countries Not just China but Japan Korea or Russia So and I mean Facebook historically has been no exception I mean we focused at we never focused on growing in a specific place When we did the college thing early on and um and the way we prioritized so we can bring new colleges online was based on how many people at colleges were requesting it But once we made an open center some even signed up It was just kind of random like where which countries follow up right Like there s one month it was Norway and then there was Turkey and it s like no real connection between these places Um so we re up in this place in the last couple of years where there are really four countries in the world um that we aren t either winning or going to win and uh clearly on the path to win And they are China Korea Japan North um South Korea Japan and and Russia And um so we start focusing on them this year and we kind of carved off China We re like Okay this one is extremely complex and has its own dynamics um so but there isn t quite as much like that in in Japan or South Korea or Russia So we start focusing on those this year and in in our our theory is that if we can show that we as the western company can succeed in a place where basically no other western companies have then that ll give us the momentum I I think you figure out the right partnerships or or things that that we would need to do in China just to succeed on our 00 24 00 terms Um on the philosophical question of openness then and how we view it my view on this is that every country is pretty difficult different and we want to be pretty culturally sensitive to them So I I really like I don t want Facebook to be an American company right Like obviously we re in America but I don t want it to be this company that just like spreads American values all across the world And we have our core values like we believe in openness um in transparency in connecting people Um and there are parts of that overlap with American values but there are different countries across the world that have different values Right so for example we have this notion of free speech that that we really love and support at Facebook and that s one of the main things that we re trying to push with openness but different countries have their different standards around that Right so for example in Germany it is illegal to post anything that is Nazi content right so what do we do We don t allow you to post Nazi content in Germany right it s considered hate speech They have a different standard for what hate speech is in Germany Um is that censoring I don t think so I think you can make an argument that it is Um but I think it s like clearly the right thing to do Um we don t block out Nazi content outside of Germany Um in Pakistan this year uh one someone of then they are users made a group everybody drum Mohammed Day and in Pakistan it s illegal to draw pictures to pick thing Mohammed Um so we got blocked in Pakistan And then we we had some dialogue with them and it s against the law there so we don t let people post pictures of Mohammed in Pakistan Um but we ve let people do that anywhere else in the world where it s not against the law So that s kind of that s our that s our take on this Um I think it s really important that countries can clearly write down what their laws are Um not everyone is happy with with what we do in all these different places I mean we get complaints in Germany from people who want to post Nazi contents Um someone in Pakistan right now is trying to give me sentence to death Um no joke or I mean maybe kind of 00 26 00 a joke but like laughter um but I don t think it s that funny um laughter uh for our philosophy there in terms of not not blocking people from drawing pictures of Mohammed across the world So anyhow look I might be when this is that you want to be really culturally sensitive and understand the way that people that actually think Um China is a very it s I think the values there somewhat different from what we have in the U S so before we do anything there I m personally spending a lot of time kind of studying it and figuring out what what I think the right thing to do is um that it is kind of a personal challenge this year I I m just taking an hour a day and I m learning Chinese Um it s like part of the um just it kind of trying to understand the other language the culture the mindset all this because it just it s such an important part of the world Or and how can you connect the whole world if you leave out a billion six people  Speaker 1 All right let s take your question around the center You in a green polo shirt Yes you   Yeah so we ve been a lot of acquisitions over the last couple of years and it s actually one of the things I think it s working pretty well for us Um so we have a specific thesis on how to do this which is we have not once bought a company for the company Um we buy companies to get excellent people So look our view is we want to build a very entrepreneurial company Um you know one thing that a lot like Mackenzie has a program where people go after college expecting to only be there for a couple of years and expecting to pick up very valuable business skills that they can take whatever they want to do after that I want Facebook to me be Mackenzie of entrepreneurship Right where you come to Facebook because it s the best place to learn how to build things and there s a lot of leverage um in terms of making it 00 28 00 so that you you can build something and your first week or over your first month if you want to have a longer project And you can um work on getting it ramped up and you can address the large user base and getting people to to use your product Um so I think the in order to have a really entrepreneurial culture one of the key things is to make sure that we re recruiting the best people who are very entrepreneurial And a lot of our attitude towards that is that a along of the best people I think want to come to Facebook because um of the culture that we have and because it s we just have enormous leverage Well I can t think of another company where the ratio of users to engineers has you know each engineer services more than a million users uh but one of the ways to do this is to just is to focus on acquiring great companies with great founders And um I think we ve probably done maybe five or six or seven of them in the last year or so And I ve been happy with how every single one of them has worked So to me that suggest that we should do a lot more of them Um and a lot of it like the teams come in they work on projects that they re passionate about It s not necessarily an extension of what they were doing at their start up I think the calculus on the start up founder s side a lot of the times is okay I m working on this project and I m really excited about it but if I got to Facebook I can have a much better impact Um and you know whether it s you know Brett Taylor we started off and originally did some of the platforms stuff and he s now CTO um or you know Blake Ross and and Joe Hewitt who joined us from Parakey who you know Blake went on to do a lot of the internationalization and growth work that we did and Joe was working a lot of the mobile stuff He built the original iPhone app and it s working on some really cool mobile stuff that we re doing now Um kind of bought company Next Stop like it s one of the things that I think is awesome And you know the fact that so many of the the people who are bidding products within Facebook um are coming from environments where they re most recently out of start up um as a founder Just creates an incredibly entrepreneurial 00 30 00 environment um out of scale where you can build stuff that that millions of people are going to be using  Speaker 1 All right Paul says your time is up right We re going to end so   Cool  Speaker 1 Thank you   Well thank you guys Clapping  Speaker 1 Thank you Mark you re awesome   Thank you '}\n"

      "{'filename': '2010-024', 'content': ' Female Cinch  Robert So we re here in the office with  So Mark what s up Laughs um the announcements you made this morning were pretty uh interesting for developers Um where do you think this is going in terms of how is our inaudible 00 00 23 changing because of social location That s really I think the key thing that I ve seen going on   I don t know I don t think it has changed much yet Um but uh I mean our view on all of the stuff is that if you look five years out like every vertical or industry is going to be rethought in a social way right So I I just just moved laughing other people out of the way That s cool  Robert  Crosstalk 00 00 53 we re all trying to record it   It was amazing how like liquid that was Um  Male He s done it before   So I mean I think that that s the big thing right The and before today I think a lot of people just thought about Facebook on mobile devices as the app right Like you you use the Facebook app or you use the Android app or you use Facebook on web uh but what we re really trying to do is build a social platform that spans every device right and with things like single sign on that s tied to logging into the Facebook app which like almost everyone has on iPhone Android It was like a real opportunity to create a whole new way of building applications Now that s a thing that I think is really exciting right I mean so as soon as we get up there we talk about you know groups on iPhone and Android and that s cool and even the Places out that we re doing I think it s cool but it s a fraction of what the total value is going to be that if you kind of look at the whole ecosystem uh of people who are going to be building social apps and using a location API s and stuff like that  Robert Reason that everybody was 00 02 00 laughing there s other journalists here in the room laughs I want I want to authorize the conversation    crosstalk 00 02 05  Robert  Laughs I know crosstalk 00 02 07    crosstalk 00 02 08 right I m okay with it  Robert I just jumped over TechCrunch laughs   It s all right I  Male I m in between Robert Scoble and  laughs crosstalk 00 02 15   But if there s so I mean if people get anything out of today I think that that s the thing to take away right It s if if yesterday you thought of Facebook as a mobile application that a lot of people are using what we re trying to do in the future is build a platform so that way you know it s not a vertical platform right It s not iPhone We re not trying to sell a phone Um what we re trying to do is no matter where you go and what phone platform you re using and probably most important is the web right mobile web Um we want to make it so that all those experiences can be social So  MG Can you talk a little bit about um  Robert That s MG Seeler 00 02 50  MG I understood that there s no phone obviously but um you know what about the idea that if you tied more deeply into something like Android if you re working on that where you can do have everything that s on the phone tied into a Facebook sign and say rather than you know it s this individual apps where you still have to go and click on that Is that something that you guys are looking towards maybe 00 03 12   Yes it s something to think about right and one of the interesting things is single sign on is not instant personalization right So instant personalization on the web is you sign into Facebook and then for a handful of partner sites where we think it makes sense to have a really seamless experience you you can automatically just have it be social and personalized And then we also have the social plug ins where we make it so that everything can be automatically um social and personalized um without any doubt of transferring or anything like that And we don t think the mobile is there just the app but we do think that in a low of ways the single sign on experience is lighter weight than the connect experience of clicking a button on the web right Um I mean I I kina made a joke about this during the presentation today but like on for any kind of single sign on 00 04 00 interface including the old version of connect before this on mobile phones it was like a non native dialogue that popped up and it literally looked like you re inaudible 00 04 08 right Um but now I mean uh one of the things that made this possible now is with fast apps switching on iPhone um it s now possible to make it so that that just switches into the Facebook app and then you authenticate there and then you can go back to the app immediately by registering a call back right with the system And um and so that s the kind of deeper thing that we re thinking of building right I was like Apple and Google and um like uh all the standards inaudible 00 04 33 HTML5 get built out more We ll just be able to do more and more and that that I think is going to be cool  Robert How does that mechanism work right now in Android So I know at iPhone it s fast app switching What happens if you re in an Android app and you click the single sign on button   Um I think Android just supports multiple apps running at the same time right Fast app switching on iPhone was there way around the fact that their architecture was based on only doing one thing at once  Robert Right So you don t even have to switch out of the app you don t think You just   Yeah no I just think you can like call it the interface 00 05 01 app  Robert Okay   Yeah  David It was exciting to hear you start to talk about uh different industries being able to be transformed by social platforms  Robert That s David Gellus 00 05 10 from Financial Talk  David Uh what other industries and when we re starting to see kind of local businesses maybe some national chains Um is it you know it s interesting to see the Palms 00 05 18 there   Yeah  David Some travel travel industries involved   So I think that um look anything around entertainment I think that it s kind of an obvious first step right So gaming is the first thing Well so personal sharing on Facebook is the first step I mean we saw it with kind of photos and groups and stuff like that where um I mean we had small teams build early apps right Teams of two or three people um build something that got an order of magnitude more usage than everything else put together and uh the takeaway from that is okay the social features are really like the killing part of this right Um having good social integrations more important than high res photos for example or extra features in a group s product Um and then this interesting 00 05 59 thing is open the 00 06 00 last five years we built all that out Um on platform gaming I think it s really been uh the runaway so far So you have really four big gaming companies that have been built on top of the platform right I mean you have Zynga which is the obvious one which by the way I don t know how many of you guys caught this news last week but their second market evaluation is now bigger than the Yay s 00 06 18  Robert Yeah   Right which is insane if you think about it I mean I think Zynga has only an order 00 06 21 of an eighth the number of employees and that s like that s disruption right And that s like a new business model that s highly more efficient than the existing one um and I mean I think that s a big part of the reason why Yay 00 06 32 is pushing to get in on this and we re working with them as well Um but so you have Zynga which is a multibillion dollar playdom which was bought for 3 quarters of a billion dollars Playfish was bought for almost half a billion dollars and then CrowdStar is kind of the fourth big one which probably um a little less valuable than Playfish currently but growing right So that that s really disruptive right Before that games were not built um with specific social dynamics in mind and now they are and uh I just think that we re going to see that in probably the other entertainment type where it goes first um and you see kind of what Apple is trying to do with iTunes and Ping and I think that s kind of going in the right direction Um so I would be surprised if there s a music thing or movies or just kind of I mean because those are naturally social things I mean it s interesting because um when we look at like the ads on Facebook right there are certain verticals that are naturally social ads that work very well Right and entertainment is kind of one category that that overtime I think eventually everything right So ecommerce I think will get there but um there s probably some more sensitivity around sharing what you re purchasing I mean there s stuff like Bluffy s 00 07 41 I mean some people are doing it but I think that that s still like earlier along but I think we ll get there and all these things  Robert What what are you learn Go ahead  Jason Uh I have a question about recommendations like at this point it seems that you re getting a ton of data as far as people checking into Places and now it seems like you in some instances might sort of a deal high rater 00 07 57 you now have 00 07 58 time to just putting deals and 00 08 00 is there any plans for inaudible 00 08 01 deals API where like Groupon and LivingSocial uh kind of distribute or syndicate rather the deals when someone signs up I know they can publish to the feed but is there first of all is there any central hub there And second when are you going to take all the data and start telling the user this is something looks like something you re going to be interested in Because at this point it shows up in your newsfeed but it doesn t sound like it s really it s not pushing a recommendation on how you uh so much as just kind of showing like oh your friend like this  Robert And that s Jason Kincaid from TechCrunch   Yeah No and I think you re right on both of those This is religious kind of the early stage right Just like Places when we originally launched it about two months ago and people had all those questions of like obvious things that we should do we weren t ready to do it yet Um I still kind of feel like that with deals and there s like so much more to take this to but um we are just starting off with this right and there s no real commercial part right It s like just the deals in we re not promoting them uh massively It s only if you are in the area that you can see it Um there s like clearly a lot more stuff that we can do Um in terms of how the API I m not real evolved I mean I kind of view it similar to what we ve done with ads I guess or like for a while we just built out an interface that people could use right and then we went to see what made sense And then after that it when it made sense we built out an API So in the future I think it s definitely in line with the vision that we have to make this an open platform that as many people can tap into as possible And um looks like we re doing it with the open graph When our our view of the world is very much that um there should be programmatic interfaces to access anything that a human can right So you want to look at my profile you go to www facebook com zach You want to have a computer look at my profile you go to graph facebook com zach All right and um eventually I think we ll get there but I but really like probably not for a while  Robert What have you learned by doing Places What what have you learned from Places And where   A lot of people like it laughing I don t know I mean that that  Robert Exactly   Wouldn t it be inaudible 00 10 00 about  Robert And that s Larry You re  Larry  Air 00 10 02 Design  Robert  Air 00 10 04 Design  Larry Um there s actually uh one good learning 00 10 06 that we have which dog tails exactly what Jason was asking about earlier Um in just uh two and a half months that we ve launched Places one of the really cool insights is that a lot of people are actually going first to their Places page before they go to Newsfeed on their phones because it s so much more relevant   Yeah it s interesting yeah  Larry I can see who s around me and what they re doing um and now the beauty of what we launched todayis that in addition to that same page we ll show offers that are near me as well and also syndicate all the different check ins from all these different platforms  Male Yeah  Male So it s truly becoming this really rich starting point from the entire social experience Um that is just within two and a half months So there s so much more than what we re discovering  Male And and that s why I started out with   Yeah that s even more of an inaudible 00 10 48 I mean if you look at one of the updates in the most recent version I don t know if we if I have any announcements 00 10 52 I just cleared it but we re now gauging the Places app Right so if there are people nearby you who you haven t see we ll like light that up and you ll just click on that and you could see So um I think even more so we re going to be going in that direction  Robert That s why we started the interview out by our buying behavior is changing because I ve been watching where you checked in and I ve tried some of those restaurants right because oh  has gone to that restaurant It must be cool It must be a good place to go right   Yeah well laughing maybe I m I m agreeing I m agreeing with you in general point not um not necessarily my  Robert Taste on restaurants   Taste on restaurants  Robert MG is actually better than you are but I I wasn t going to let him know that laughing   But I mean the power of social recommendation is obviously a big driver of all the stuff Right I mean it s I think why you can integrate in a person s friends into almost anything and make the app instantly more engaging and viral is because it s like I mean take any of these examples uh photos groups 00 11 52 games commerce whatever like you care so much more about your friends Right it s not like an intellectual thing It s like hardwired 00 12 00 into humans that you need to focus on what the people around you are doing and I don t know I just think it s like this very visceral deep thing Um and that I think is the structural thing that s going to make it so that all these industries change and uh going back to your other question about what we ve learned from Places Um one of the things that I ve been pretty surprised about is the value of the tagging I mean I thought that those are going to be really cool but like it s even better than I thought it was going to be Um and I just find that look I rarely ever want to check in just to say I m at a place but like I often want to like share who I m with right because that s a social experience and it just it works so well as a social dynamic because a lot of the time the people I m with are completely fine sharing where they re with but they just wouldn t have check in the right themselves right So like everyone has different thresholds Some people would check in just to say where they are Some people would check in to say who they re with Some people would never check in but are okay being checked in Some people don t ever want location data about them but the app is designed in a way that you can like express more of this data than a lot of people would put in themselves but are happy with it So that s been very powerful in my experience  Robert Do do you think you re would then give users the ability to control what gets shared on other people s feeds because if I check in it safely I don t I don t want to mess up MG s feed with that right But if I m checking in uh   Oh if you if you um oh you re talking about his newsfeed on the homepage  Robert Yeah yeah you know because right now all check in s are  Male  crosstalk 00 13 24 out for me  Robert Yeah well or give the ability to say this one s not really important enough to show up on MG s page but if I m you know hanging out with Zach at French Laundry that s I want MG to be jealous about that right Laughing  Female Wow laughing   Um  Robert Well that s why we check in right I check my wife and I check people in because of different    crosstalk 00 13 45 jealous  Robert Absolutely laughing It s one of the reasons   Yeah yeah laughing um  Male Scoble and Zach laughing   I d like  Male French Laundry   Yeah um  Robert I was I was jealous that I wasn t checked in with you there laughs 00 14 00   Yeah I mean uh uh I think look as there s more information on the system making it so that people can effectively filter that Obviously it becomes more important but  Male  Wasn t 00 14 12 my direction now so on www facebook com um any newsfeed story if you just to the upper right hand corner you guys go check it out inaudible 00 14 19 but there s a little X So you can actually per object um say you vote up or just I never want to see this again right and hide  Robert But it s not it s I don t want to get rid of all places check ins I only I don t want to see when MG s at the Safeway I do want to see when he s hanging out with you know crosstalk 00 14 36 the CEO or something like that  Male It s the first step It s a first step towards being able to start giving feedback into the system to see what you like and what you dislike and it s just a matter of time We re going to that  Robert Absolutely I d use that a lot somewhere in the future  Male Um clears throat for a second I know Robert wants to know this too Can we talk a little bit about what like Google is doing Because they re also obviously making a heavy push into Places You know they ve been rolling out different API s and they ve been making these Places pages Uh have you guys you know kind of worked with them at all about any of this stuff Are you thinking about working with them Is it kind of going to be a you versus them thing for this foundation of Places   I think some of the stuff that they re doing is pretty good It s different right I mean because they re more focused on the MAC data and the Places data So one area where I think the services compete is we have the Places search API that we launched today and this is kind of a different view of getting that than than Google s Um and Google obviously has like years ahead of us So mapping stuff out of their satellites and like all these crazy stuff So I mean that s awesome but um and this is going to be an interesting example over the next couple of years to see how these different methods of organizing information play out right I mean just like we talked about at um at the groups event that we did I guess at those just a few weeks ago right Um uh I ll give this example of photos where you know before people tagging came out I think most people to inaudible 00 15 54 that the best way to like figure out who s in photos is like have some face recognition algorithm but it actually turns out the best way to do it is just have 00 16 00 people tag Um and I think you know the databases that you know that we re building out and I mean even to some extent at like Four Squares building out um there s much more it s much more about people dynamics in that and I I think because that is going to grow a lot quicker but I think but Google has been doing this for years So I think that their service is quite good there  Robert Are you going to make a deal with Microsoft to get their card data their camera data their mapping data into Facebook So that you can display new things with   I mean we are we re with Microsoft on maps um I don t know We I think like in order of in terms of seeding the data we worked with like a number of different folks to get some data in because then you want to have like a good baseline before you set the dynamics so people can edit stuff but I mean there s a whole sophisticated system that the team has built where it s like you create a place and then your friends can see it but it s not global yet and then if a bunch of other people check in then it s like promoted to be global So we want to keep it like very high quality  Robert Yeah  Male It s inaudible 00 16 56 you launched Places but it s also have been 00 16 58 a few months more than that since you really rolled out the open graph API and I wonder if you re also going to talk about   Busy year laughing  Male Yeah Um and I d like inaudible 00 17 09 the question what have you learned from the open graph API I think you know Like buttons and social plug ins are installed A million sites around the web now and it seems like you re starting to have the opportunity to really look and see how is this changing the way people move around the web how this is changing the way you know people navigate from one place to another and and discovering new sites and and   Um you know the open graph stuff is still on its infancy right and when we roll that out we talked about the Like plug in and the Like button as one type of edge but the whole vision of the open graph is like we want to make it so that all these different web 2 0 company sort of going to inaudible 00 17 47 they re building their own webs of different stuff right can meet those into operable 00 17 51 and and all these different graphs that different services have have their own object types and their own relationships and actions between those and eventually you want to map all 00 18 00 like make it so they can map all that stuff out and that you know a service that um gets built on top of Facebook can access their friends but can also access you know the music database from iTunes or different things and inaudible 00 18 13 common language So Like is really just a start to that Um it s still really early Um and I think it s going pretty well and the Like button is such a simple interaction that people can click on it and um and again going back to the social recommendation stuff it s more about the people than actually the object right So look if you re producing content the reason why your friend isn t going to care about that content is because they care about their friend right Um and I think that that just drives like a huge amount of click throughs and um at some point someone will do a study There s actually a good TechCrunch article I don t know I forgot which one of you guys wrote it but the one on EventBrite about the value of a click  Robert Yeah   And laughing crosstalk 00 18 57 um and I I felt that that was like a good early analysis um that was kind of like one case but once you can start to break down with the value of someone No it s the value of a share right There was on EventBrite it like if for every person you shared something to Newsfeed that created this amount of value and I just think that so right now we kind of experience this anecdotally like okay games are more engaging like photo tags are sweet right But um but when you start getting into things that are much like economic tradeoffs like ecommerce which I still think would be kind of later in the whole revolution Um I think a lot of that is going to come down to boiling down and understanding like very clearly like if I share this like this thing right then that makes more money for Amazon or whoever that the company is that s allowing the share so therefore Amazon should actually give you some incentive to share stuff right and like and I think it ll just kind of ripple through the whole system like that Um so anyhow I still think it s really early like the Like button is creating a lot of value Um the measurement of it is kind of is a bit behind 00 20 00 We have more than a million sites that are using social plug ins So that part is going well Um but there s so much more to do  Male You you talked about kind of the impact that it s having on the web 2 0 companies but I think what s been very striking is how um a lot of mainstream sites whether it be Best Buy or New York Times have really adopted it and you made these sites that are previously not been social at all very social And sometimes 00 20 20 when I go to the Times I see what all my friends have recommended Can you just talk about the importance of that and how you see that playing on Again it s very early but where does this go when you start seeing very mainstream sites that haven t been social start to become social in the future   I I think it s kind of I mean it s fascinating right Um one of the things that we re seeing is that there are two types of social implementations One I mean we re pretty far away from the mobile stuff that we re supposed to be talking about but um chuckles but I think that this stuff is also pretty interesting There are sites that integrates some Facebook functionality and then there are sites and apps that are really like designed from the ground up to be social and uh I think like the state of social networking is that it s at the point where like everyone in this inaudible 00 21 07 of knowledge that um that social networking is kind of important right It s like in the enterprise phase I think the way of putting it is no one s going to get fired for focusing on social networking right No one s going to get fired for having a social strategy but there s a different between these two um types of approaches I mean I think a lot of these apps are really just they implement some social stuff to check a box to say that like they got their social implementation and then they re done Um and then there are companies like Zynga that are really like going all in and like investing and saying Okay well I want all of our users to have access to a social API um and all be in kind of social mode and all be sharing and what s that going to look like Um so in a way the social plug ins are actually extremely light right It s good It s good I mean it makes it so that the people can share stuff on their sites Um sites that weren t at all social before can now be and now there s more engagement and growth and all that good stuff that mathematically we can show comes from that but um but I 00 22 00 still think of a lot of those implementations are extremely light and the real disruption is going to come from people like rethinking these spaces  Robert Yeah  Male I have a question Um   If you look at backload of the stuff that we re doing today I mean this is where the single sign on stuff is so fundamental right I just think that there s a huge difference between an app where some of your users might be logged into Facebook and some of those might click a Like button and something were like a fundamental part of the experience is you load the app click log in with Facebook the app developer can assume that the majority of their users are using Facebook and have a social API So you can just like build the experience in a completely different direction because of that So  Male Are are you seeing any increasing hesitation from third party developers as you guys roll out new API s I mean historically Facebook has really owned social graph and increasingly you re going to have the interest graphs with the Like through like on you re going to have Places and it sounds like you may have more API s in the future regarding say deals in ecommerce Uh I m a third party developer it seems like this definitely inaudible 00 23 00 barrier of entry for me to get into the game but it also makes it much easier for competitors when I also do something similar and you have to build off that Are you seeing any hesitation from third parties to use this write API s to submit this data to Facebook Because they are worried that it ll be easier for someone else and kind of eat their lunch   Yeah it s actually that s a good question So this is like a principle that we have pretty strongly internally A lot of people have asked us like can I have a version of the write API where my stuff is quarantined So I want to write it and get all the distribution benefits of putting in all this people s Newsfeeds and all that but I don t want my competitors still to suit them 00 23 33 right That s exactly what you re saying Um we ve taken a really firm stance on that to like no this is an open graph like it s an open platform Um we want to make it so that it s the user s data It s not yours right So like basically the user is sharing it Um they should be able to share that data with any application or take it anywhere that they want Um and what we found is that um sometimes when we re trying to build partnerships that ll like stall it out for a few months right but like fundamentally the 00 24 00 functionality is so powerful that eventually people come back and they re like All right fine like I didn t want to do it the first time because you didn t you wouldn t do what we wanted but now that we are seeing our competitors do it or we just thought about it more we like really want to see that happen  Male And speaking of that a bit um I know and this might have been just because the write API wasn t open until today fully You know it s only been a like Four Squares as an example of someone who is pushing data to you guys and um but they were only pushing it not waiting to phase with Places right It was only uh they were linking to their own elements you know when you clicking 00 24 31   Unstructured yeah  Male Yeah so it s unstructured So are you guys doing away with that Will they not be able to do it anymore or are you still going to be open to that or do you really   Well crosstalk 00 24 40  Male want to tie them with places   Uh our view is that it s actually not Four Square sharing that it s like people right  Male Yeah of course   People can make whatever unstructured post they want  Male  Crosstalk 00 24 49   But overtime and this is a big part of the open graph is that if we understand the semantics ofhow the data is structured then we can just do so much more interesting stuff right So I mean the first where I can publish something or the they 00 25 02 can enable their users to publish something um that shows that it s been received 00 25 06 that s just like a straight chair that has no semantic value attached to it but if they don t say like okay this is a place and the place is here then like we can show it and your friends nearby We can t do all these other things and this is like our view on how disruption happens right It s like companies will be afraid of changing and they will not take advantage of somebody s new things and they will all get beaten by companies that go all in And it will take time right and I think some of these industries um are quite entrenched but like I just think overtime this stuff is so powerful  Male Can you talk a little bit about uh like what were your recommendation be to some of these other companies you know like you know we saw them loop 00 25 47 today we saw you know there s obviously inaudible 00 25 50 There s a lot of them out there right now You re kind of taking this deals element away from them for their business model because you re giving it away free or you know you said that that you won t 00 26 00 be charging for it uh these companies Um so they you know a lot of them have been doing this stuff for free but kind of what the idea that going forward you know they might strike a deal with a company and now maybe that company won t think twice about that because you know they could just do a deal with you guys and have also these deals through Facebook So   Mm hmm affirmative  Robert what do you kind of think about the the ecosystem I guess with the location space and what people should go towards   Yeah I think it s none of this stuff is exclusive right So it s kind of advertising Like you advertise on Google and Yahoo and Facebook right It s like why Because you want to reach people in all those places right So it s not like someone does something on Yahoo and then decides not to do it in the others Um you do it wherever it s valuable So  Male You think all ships are kind of rising like this will I think this is expanding pretty quickly   No I mean at some point that might go in a different direction but um but right now I think like if you re trying to get customers you should go anywhere where you can get customers for lower than the cost of what the customers are going to be valued to right That s like so um so we think we have a good solution because we re not charging anything right laughs um but um but that doesn t mean that doesn t take away from anything that anyone else is doing  Robert Yeah  Male There s a lot of opportunity to differentiate on just the product level  Male Sure right  Male I mean this is such a huge space where so early on um there s actually a company that TechCrunch actually writes about quite frequently Scavenger right  Robert Right  Male Scavenger is doing very interesting things Part of the reason why the um invite them to join our 00 27 26 beta programs inaudible 00 27 28 laughing Yeah we asked them to join our beta because we re so excited about the kind of vision they have of starting enterprise first building this contest platform that lets the Patriots or the Celtics like create really interesting offers That s not something which you come to Facebook for That s a very customized experience So it s just a huge space where I think there s a lot of room for all the 00 27 49 players  Robert It sounds like you guys are still very very focused on people and that s what I see when I go with the Places right I see people I see MG checked in here Brad checked in here 00 28 00   Mm hmm affirmative  Robert Are you ever going to shift to uh showing other things or letting me see more about the place that people are checking into and tell a story about the place like putting up photos of the place and putting up comments about the place like like all of that sorted out   Yeah so there s  Male  Crosstalk 00 28 18 just to go on the photos that I m able to then add to uh a check in do those show up on the Place page now   Well they do but they re yours right So assuming that that s  Male So they re not public   Well unless you make them public right So um and we have the whole pages product right and that s pretty widely used and there are like all these pages that have millions of people and a lot of pages that inaudible 00 28 37 there Um and there are still a lot to do there in that specific part of what we do but I mean people is just it s just such a fundamental part of crosstalk 00 28 47  Robert  crosstalk 00 28 48   to people laughing that like it s like that s like what you care about that um that I think is  Robert  crosstalk 00 28 53   like the strongest product element that we have and like likely one of the strongest product elements that ever existed right So I mean that s so I mean our view in the whole platform strategy is like we re not going to build out everything on top of that We want to make it so that this is explorable 00 29 06 so other people can tap into that and build all these awesome things  Robert But I I do like seeing like Four Squares icons that show you what kind of place it is that you just checked into and uh I d like to see more of that I d love to see more story telling about place by people   Yeah yeah  Robert I d love to hear your story maybe even the Cinch cast and attach that to the check in you know  Female  crosstalk 00 29 29  Robert Just use crosstalk 00 29 31 Laughing   Yeah  Robert Or you can crosstalk 00 29 32 more of uh  Male  crosstalk 00 29 35 pictures I had was actually just this last weekend or last week So I got lucky and was able to see um game one  Robert Me too  Male You were there  Robert Oh  Male Actually I saw you were there You know why Because you re in the here now section of my check in You crosstalk 00 29 47 laughing  Robert Yeah laughs  Male There you go Served it right  Robert You know I m bragging I want to make everyone else jealous laughing  Male But I don t know if you looked at the Place page after you checked in coughs or you could actually see everyone s comments during the game It 00 30 00 was the thought I had was like how awesome would it be if we just made this a little bit more like known then you could even if you weren t lucky to be at the game um you could just go to that Place page and in real time see people s comments as the game is happening from the perspective of being there Um and imagine being able to see the tag in photos the real time comments It s like the true live stream of the game 360 degrees  Robert Oh absolutely  Male Um and that s just that s what we have today and in uncertain unstructured  Robert I have a lot of experiences where you check in to a restaurant and your social graph tells you Oh you better try this on the menu because people have bought them in there And I love that real timeness about it  Male And I uh I wonder deals is obviously a natural place to start to kind of incentivize this kind of behavior but I was interested to see charitable giving as a part of this and what we re talking about now it starts to seems that um you know mass adoption of check in can actually change behavior beyond just kind of incentivizing to buy something here and there Can you talk about your thoughts of you know how does when everyone s checking in what is kind of mass location awareness on the social graph what might that what else might that enable   I mean just like all these different personalization examples right Uh and the the whole thing that we re trying to do is connect and um all right it was we have this instant personalization for inaudible 00 31 22 and the whole idea is that like the whole next generation about locations are all going to be personalized too right Social elements are I think probably the most powerful part of that personalization right and even when you have location involved it s like because you mostly want to see people who are around you right Um but the idea is like if you re going to meet a person like the more you know about them the better of a conversation you can have like the better of like an interface that you can create It s like isn t our software like that right And it s like why do we have software that assumes that every person that s using it is the same It s crazy right So and I just think we re going to look back in five years 00 32 00 like wonder like why it was like uh that that so 00 32 05 location is obviously one element about you That s like very hyper um contextualized too  Male Mm hmm affirmative  Male So we have one more question then we got to wrap up  Male The most important question laughing  Male  crosstalk 00 32 20 the company  Male Yeah  Male Who s the company that could go boring laughing  Male You mentioned briefly that you re working with a team of Android developers to create your Android thing laughs and that uh Google stepped in and bought that   Yeah I thought that was obnoxious laughing  Male Do you know who it was just like   Uh it was like this it was this really small shop that we re working with but that s like they created it  Male It s like one developer it s a team there s 00 32 43 a company   No well yeah so crosstalk 00 32 46 laughing So but like but it s the main thing that they were working right It wasn t like there was some shop and this any other reason why like Google had to buy them but it it it was obviously wasn t a huge deal but I mean but it it definitely set us back for a while and like I don t know but it was kind of frustrating  Male Did you lose all the progress that you made on the application at that point or   Well I mean we definitely didn t have that person working on it anymore right and that like person had all the momentum and all that So I think we had the relationship worked out that we could use the code going forward and stuff like that but like  Male Sort of like a crosstalk 00 33 18 guy   But he was not it wasn t great  Robert Yeah  Male Now we just have to figure out who it was  Robert One bonus question what what about iPad laughs   I mean eventually we ll build something like I think it s the it s different enough from like what I mean then disagreed with me when I said that iPad wasn t mobile I mean I think like you can argue with semantics of that but I think it s clearly a different form factor than this and um  Robert My mobile phone   What s that  Robert The phone you pointed at 00 33 45    Crosstalk 00 33 45 on the mobile phone So just like porting between thing is not as obvious and um and like we just want to be good All right We want stuff that we launch to be good  Robert You ll do a mobile web app now 00 33 55 for the iPad   What s that  Robert It sounds like you were talking about a web 00 34 00 application then for the tablet form pad  Male The point is that you can use the web form factor crosstalk 00 34 03   And what s wrong That s what I use on my iPad  Male But what what about all those people who are searching you know on the Appstar for it and they come upon that friendly thing  Male These guys must be crosstalk 00 34 12  Male Which suggests our touch type  Male Yeah so this touch like wrapped 00 34 15 in this thing but they re selling it So like those guys must be making so much money Isn t that kind of a weird situation   Yeah I mean the our view over the long term is that the development and ecosystem right now is kind of crazy right There s like all these different I talked about this a little bit at StarApps I don t know if you guys if you guys were there but um it s like we were getting started on 2004 with Facebook There was like no question what we were going to build or like what platform we were going to build on top of right It s like software development was kind of already ah right like too complicated and like you don t want to make people download something like mobile environment is more mature enough and all So this occurring 00 34 52 of course we re going to build for the web but like today if you re building something from scratch it s like all right You re going to build a website but by the way now like there s a good Javascript that and and kind of all these Ajax type directions that work in some place and not others So you probably want like different versions of the website and then you want um a simple mobile website and probably HTML5 mobile website and iPhone app and an Android app and iPad app and Win app and like all these different things and it s just like insane right And something has to rationalize all these and I think our view overtime is the HTML5 environment that is being created across all these should be a very valuable thing for making it so that we could build all these So um but regardless like I think the the modern app development environment is definitely like you build apps that people use in multiple places It s not just like you build a website It s like you build a website but then you also build a mobile experience and then you probably also built something inside a social network because that s how you get a lot of exposure to a lot of users and um but the more we can make those all web that that I think is good  Robert Very cool thank you   Yeah thanks  Male Thank you '}\n",

say Um I I didn t mean that the way it sound laughs I m so sorry Um but ye yesterday you had a very big announcement Um or perhaps just yet another announcement in in laughs what has been a series of a lot of big announcements recently Almost all of them are happy with the themes that we ve been talking about here This one was messaging So um many folks have said this is a Gmail killer Um and when we ask Carol Bartz uh to say one word after uh I said Facebook she said Competitor laughs Um I think that s because of mail Um I m not sure it was because of Facebook finance Um uh so laughs Uh give us your you know encapsulated view of what messages is about in and how it differentiates because I think people might be a bit confused by the framework of mail   Sure I mean we we went into this looking not to build an email product right But thinking about you know what would be a modern messaging system if um if if if we rethought this from scratch And you know one of the interesting things I started off th th the conference yesterday a little press conference giving the story of You know a a couple of Thanksgivings ago I was hanging out with um with my girlfriend s family and my girlfriend has this sister who s in high school So whenever whenever I get a chance to talk to high school kids I always wanna ask them uh wh what type of stuff they are using right Because you know I think I m kinda young but when you talk to high schoolers you like feel old immediately right  John Yeah I know laughs   And um so And you know so I was asking them kind of stuff are you using right Do you use email do you use like th these different social networks do you use um like different iPhone apps And so when we go to email I was like All right wh what do you use And they re like Well you know some of us 00 02 00 use Gmail and probably most of us use Gmail Um a bunch of us use Yahoo Um but we don t really use it that much I was like Wh why Everyone uses email They got Well it s too slow I m like What do you mean it s too slow like email is instantaneous You send an email and it gets delivered And it it what they ve mean was that it was too formal right Th the types of communication that a lot of people are doing these days um you know things like SMS and IM are just a lot simpler right I mean you don t have to remember an address um you you you pick out someone s name that you want to send something to you send it to them Um you don t have to think of a subject line You don t need to say Hey mom at the beginning You don t need to say Love Mark at the end Um it doesn t need to You know there s no paragraphs or you don t need to keep track of different threads or anything like that It s just really simple And I I think that messaging in the future is gonna resemble that a lot more recent It s a lot more natural You know I mean we have one thread or at a conversation between us You know I don t have 20 different conversations So mapping it out like that we think makes a lot more sense So when we kinda got started thinking about how to build a messages product we didn t come at it from the perspective of Oh let s add email functionality We came at it from the perspective of Let s take away everything that we can right So we got rid of subject lines Um we got rid of the divide between IM and messages on on Facebook Um so those are now the same thing and we made it so now it s interoperable with email as well and SMS And I kind of have one system where you can just send people simple messages and it can get delivered to people wherever they are If they re on Facebook it will pop up as an IM If they re not then they can come back and it can get delivered to their inbox If they have their phone um and they have the iPhone app that can get send as a push notification If they don t it can get sent as an SMS Um if they want it can get sent as an email Um seamless So that s what we re doing  Tim So there are the things though that that people are in your friend graph and so of course one of the advantage of the email is this uh name space that you can discover and you can communicate with people who you re not connected with 00 04 00 So how do you think about that in the context of  John Well so one of the things that is very good to solve with um with the social graph is spam right  Tim Mm hmm affirmative   You know it it s been a a classic email problem Um you know email filters developed past 10 or 15 years have gotten very good at filtering out the real jump right So you don t get a lot of like Viagra email anymore But you do get a lot of random emails from em or from services that you subscribe or uh that you subscribe to Um you know different things that you connect to but you may not be that interested in hearing from And you know one thing that email can t do is differentiate between two real people who your Who are both real people sending you legitimate emails but it it it can differentiate between which one do you like more right Um  Tim Well Gmail is starting to do the good job with that with priority inbox   Yeah I know and that stuff is is is pretty cool I it does factor in  John It would be better if you use Facebook Connect I think  Tim Yeah a absolutely Yeah   But but I mean I think for a long time people have agreed that the real way to solve spam and filtering is you should have a list of the people that you want to hear from right And we can just do that so easily for people because they have their friend s list Their friends have their friend s list So we can tell not only who were the people that you communicate with but who are the people in your network who are likely to be sending you something that s interesting um  Tim There s a fair amount of manual curation there that gets old pretty fast if you re in contact with a lot of people Uh uh do you see automation of that in your future Uh you know the way that that Google is Even though they don t always deliver on the promise they re trying to get algorithm like about figuring out who who you really wanna communicate with   Yeah I mean I think a a lot of the products that we build have the property that you create social dynamics for people explicitly wanna share things with other people And that ends up being a better way to um to filter things then you can get through an algorithm right  Tim Mm hmm affirmative   I I I think you know I mean some of the examples of products that we ve launched or worked on recently are good examples of this So I mean photos 00 06 00 goes back a while Um Groups is pretty recent But they both have this property right If you would ask people like ten years ago what would be the best way to take a big set of photos and identify the people in them Most people said you should probably have like a face recognition algorithm or something like that and kinda crunch all the photos Um but it turns that it s just a lot easier to let people tag your photos of their friends and create a good interface where you you have your friend s list there and you could do that Um it s just it works really well Um and you know the same thing with groups right I mean people have have come up with with interface that you try to sort people into groups automatically Um what we found I mean Groups has been one of our fastest growing products ever Um and what we ve found is that it just it works really well when you can put your friends into a group right I mean one person does manual work and they do the work for the network right So you know you got 5 or 10 of users putting all their friends into groups and now everyone can use um th this products for effective small group communication It s really cool  John Some people don t like being put into groups   Well they can leave those groups  John But they don t like being put in it in the first place Um and and then they gota bunch of mail  Tim It s it s a kind of spam different kind of spam  John Well I mean it s just an interesting There s a there s a sort of To pull back a bit Th There is something about Facebook which and and I think you you ll acknowledge is which is that it it sort of doesn t ask for permission and ask for forgiveness That seems to be a Facebook sort of trait That it sort of like Well we ll just keep pushing that envelope and tell Oops okay sorry we hear you and then you ve listen and you pull back and that happened with the user ID in rape Rapleaf uh you know uh incident and it happened with groups too It s like all of the sudden I was put in all these groups they started getting all these mail I m like Don t and then I had to go change my permissions and say No don t send this stuff and so on and so forth Um is that a an intentional point of view or is it sort of An and I m not against that As a matter of fact there s m m many cases when you know I ve set the boards that I ve 00 08 00 had to face Sorry Right I mean is is that is that you put laughs You know I didn t ask for permission I ask   You know  John  Now I m asking for forgiveness So is that Do you do you does that resonate with you   Well our view is that the friend relationship is meaningful right And that s the whole point of having a two Uh bi directional relationship instead of a one way fell in level right It s a confirmed thing I mean we re friends In this graph what that means is that you now have the right to do certain things You can post on my page  John Right   You can tag me in photos  John Right   Um now filtering in my inbox has uh sorted on that too because now any of your friends can send a message that goes through my inbox So that s really how we look at it But I mean a lot of these that we re talking about  John But you don t have a right to export my data   What s that  John We don t You don t have a right to export my data You ve made that very clear in this war with with Gmail   Well well Yeah I mean th th the view there is that everyone owns their own information and has the ability to export it right So if you upload photos I mean you can export that and take it anywhere you want through Connect and we ve made that really easy And if you want you can just download all that in a Zip file Now I I think email is a little bit different from social networks in this way And in that In an email program if you have an address book you ve put all the addresses in there So those addresses are very much your information right And downloading that I think is a no brainer In a social network you know your friend list I think is your information right I mean so you your set of connections But if you have an email attached to your account that s yours Now I I think there s It s it s it s gray though right I mean I I When we think about this there s information that s clearly yours right Like if you upload a photo album or write a blog post that s yours right Um there s information that s clearly not yours right If it someone else s photo album  John Right   Um and then there s information that maybe is somewhere int he middle When I think um you know maybe a photo that you took that I m tagged in maybe is somewhere in the middle It s like what is my rights or what are my rights for what I should be able to do with that 00 10 00 Um What should I be able to do with um your email address if we re friends and I can see your email address Um and I think that was our kind of unsolved problems  John Well that s good That s Right   And I think we need to sort through that So I I m not sure we re a 100 right on this Um but I do think it s not way that simple  Tim I think you re I   And we re trying to think through these things  John Right   And be respectful with all th the forces that are at play right Because on one that we do here a lot You know we we Our value system is a very strong line of sight of openness and and and portability and that s why we ve build Connect which in in You know as far as I can tell it s th the single largest system that allows people to bring their data from one system to another that s ever been created Um but you know we hear most of the time There s there s a a community here that I think is very invested in stuff and and we feel pretty aligned with that because we think that in a lot of ways that s the future That s what s enabling a lot of the new applications and great stuff to get built But the feedback that we get on a day to day basis from hundreds of millions of people is more along the lines of we want control of all the information that we put into the site I want to make sure that if I upload a photo album that stays with exactly the set of people that I said could see it And um it s just mediating that attention I think is is challenging Yeah  Tim So so so one of the options is to say Okay I m okay with this information to be downloaded I mean it it seems to me that uh you know however you get the email address you have the option manually to transfer it from one place to another If if it s visible to you then   Mm hmm affirmative  Tim  Effectively you have it It seems a bit of sophistry to say Oh we well that s really private information and you can t own it I mean And if you can suck it in from from Google certainly seems that it it ought to be symmetrical that they ought to be able to crosstalk 00 11 40   No I mean I think what you re saying is definitely true  Tim Yeah Yeah   And this is a design principle What we have said I mean you take photos for an example  Tim Yeah   If you set a photo to be visible to friends only  Tim Yeah    And we re friends and I see that and I go to share it with someone else who s not my friend technically I can download it and send it an email to my friend But if you try to send it to them through Facebook we give an error message 00 12 00  Tim Yeah   Right I mean that s just we re trying to give user control I mean th this is an example where these two things are somewhat at odds in attention I just think the correct answer isn t completely obvious  Tim Yeah I I I agree with that   I m not sure that we re completely right but it s but it s not I think a completely black and white thing  John This is the thing that I find fascinating both about Facebook and where we are a as a culture is that you know we we could talk for two hours on this stage about this and and and and probably maybe make a little progress in understanding a a a conversation that is ongoing in our culture that has not finished as you point out   Mm hmm affirmative  John On the other hand we have now you know the congress sort of interested not just in this question but very specifically in your in your company How do you handle you know I mean a headline such as Facebook response prompt strong words from privacy law makers There s a new congress and and the the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee Joe Barton incoming he said In the next congress uh we in our sub committees are going to put Internet privacy policies in the cross hairs Can you go to them and say Look we re figuring it out laughs Leave us alone for now laughs   No But this is what I was saying I think right now a lot more of the feedback that we get is on the side of Users need complete control of making sure that anything that they put on the site will only go to the people who they say it will go to Right And my guess would be that over the next you know few years I don t know how long this this will take to play out Um the data portability and openness side of this will It will become a lot more obvious why that s valuable  John Yeah   And the types of great experiences that can be created through that But I think right now a lot more people are just on the side of asking for for user control And um I don t know It s yeah I mean y you just said we can be up here for two hours and have this discussion  John Yeah   I mean this is something These are some of the intellectual debates that we have inside the company everyday  John Right   I mean frankly it s one of the reasons why being at Facebook now is so exciting right I mean I I think we are kind of at the forefront of some of these issues which were really unsolved issues 00 14 00 in in the industry And um I don t know trying to to come up with solutions and propose them is a really interesting problem and an exciting thing to be doing  Tim Yeah I have to say I I I do think despite the fact that it s a very tough position to be in with uh for example congress The approach we re taking is right We got to figure out go push the boundaries and figure out where they are because if we um set rules too early we won t figure it out We just won t We re gonna stay in the past So  John I want to um ask you about a couple of uh uh questions of of of competition Um it strikes me and I And we talked about it that s the last time you you re here on this stage That that you really going You you re in a very interesting phase You re in what some may call the pre IPO stage I won t even bother asking you when that s happening because you you ll you ll your eyes will face it  Tim You don t have to go to crosstalk 00 14 54 you know   Well a couple of years ago you asked me crosstalk 00 14 56  John I asked you a couple of years ago and you re like it will be a couple years from now It s like Ugh it s so far away a couple years from now Um so I m waiting for that S1 to drop But um laughs But I know it s   Don t hold your breath chuckle  John Yes don t hold your breath exactly Um but but you know there is something that I I wonder w with with Open Graph and and Facebook Connect on so many uh and likes and everything just spreading out across the web It strikes me already to distribute Facebook s business model off domain Um and and do uh a f friend or a social graph driven uh ad network Uh not on like uh with Google did about this time in it It s history six years in which was AdSense Um d d do you think that s a reasonably good idea   Well I think it s earlier stage than Google is when when they did that So I I I have no idea when or if it will make sense to do something like 00 16 00 that Um I mean w we spent a lot of time building up our ad system and making it crosstalk 00 16 03  John You have a very very good as I understand it in a very profitable ad system that s starting to scale to the billions in revenue just for your domain   Well we we re doing okay Um laughs  John I ve heard   You know  John But the web is much bigger There s a whole another web out there that s waiting for  Tim And you ve been very successful with non monetized uh Facebook reaching out on to the web  John Right so you ve got sort of the You re in Yo you just need to light that all the way up  Tim The worrying is there The worrying is there   So I mean yeah we we re getting started wi with ads and I think that that s ramping up well And um you know one of the more important  John Now figure isn t just getting started   Well I I think it is Um and  John I figured that you ve landed and taken over with a lot of territories   I think we have a lot left to do Um and you know same on the credit side where where that one is really just getting started And he heres the way that I look at it R rather than kinda pushing out any of these systems a aggressively or anything like that I think that over the next five years most industries are going to get re though to be social and designed around people Well I mean this is kind of the evolution that we have seen at Facebook right When we started um just built the first Facebook directory product when I was in college Th th the whole theory was you know there were all these products out there You know if you wanted music you can use Kazaa back then right Or iTunes Um If you wanted um reference material you could use Wikipedia If you want to search the web you could use Google If you wanted to look up um anything to buy you can use Amazon There is no people service And this struck us It s really weird because um you know people are just Humans are hardwired to be very interested in in people Psychology it s it s deeply wired into our brain So we built this this directory people service And it immediately became um the most engaging product that that was on the web right We didn t have the biggest user base immediately but it it had the most usage um per user 00 18 00 from the beginning And um  Tim Where are those numbers today I mean what s your   Um and we still And one of the things that s crazy is we still have more than 50 of people who are on Facebook using it everyday Um so yeah more more than 500 million people More than 50 everyday Um and now it s it s growing because of all the mobile stuff Uh but You know so then a few years then a couple of engineers th that the company kind of branched off and said We re gonna build different products right And we got photos We got the first version of groups and events And at this phase all these projects kinda have the same thing in common They were groups of two or three people um competing against whole startups that were out there right I mean Flickr was a a photo sharing start up and that s all that they did right And there were group companies and event companies and you know we have these teams of two or three people and they were building u usually over a period of just a couple of months very simple versions of these products right I mean our initial photo product didn t have high resolution photos It didn t have printing You can t even reorder the photos in an album But the thing that it had was it was very deeply socially integrated right I mean you upload a photo and it went to all your friends immediately and they could all see it and they could I mean they could interact with you around it And it turned out that that social feature was more important than every other feature put together And very quickly our photos product became the most used photos product on the web Same thing with Groups Same thing with Events Over the last five years we ve kind of filled in a lot of those products to make them more fully featured because we think you should have high quality and good social products But the bottom line that we found was that um you make something social and that kind of rethinks the whole space right A social version of anything can almost always be much more engaging and out perform a non social version So 2007 we we we pivoted and said Okay instead of building all these little things ourselves let s pull the platforms that other people can build these And since then we ve seen a lot of really interesting innovation and um  Tim But you are also building them yourself I mean Facebook Places is a good example   We We re building some ourselves We re building some ourselves but a lot of them 00 20 00 we re not gonna build ourselves right And um uh especially around content right So I mean the games uh part of the platform has been really interesting I mean Fred was just talking about this one when he was up here before and they re have been four really good game companies that have been built almost entirely on top of Facebook right I mean Zynga Playfish Playdom and CrowdStar are are really meaningful companies I mean Playdom was just bought for three quarters of a billion dollars Playfish um was bought for almost half a billion dollars Um Zynga obviously independent and worth multiple billions of dollars Um but th the way that we look at this is that you know I mean that s really disruptive right I mean Zynga s market cap I think at this point is greater than EA is right And that s like a structural disruption in the industry because they um went at it and built social games They re just much more engaging on a on a pre user basis  Tim Okay What you just said contradicts Fred Wilson s point that Zynga is the only uh successful company built on the Facebook platform You just named four snicker   Well Well th The way that we look at it is if you look at a lot of platforms I I do agree that games have been the first big vertical to tip right And that that have gotten rethought to be completely social But I think that s actually true on most platforms right I mean iPhone and and iPad um games were some of the first major things that took off Even if you go back to the early PC um some of the first things that got people to bring PC s into their home were games  John So what do you think the next things are   Um it s really tough to predict because I think a lot of it comes down to excellent entrepreneurs with vision right And I mean That it it really isn t like it s not obvious right You You just don t like plug social stuff in it that works  John These excellent entrepreneurs in the audience would like to know the ones you re gonna do so they can steer clearly laughs   Well I I think you know anything that It s I think it s actually pretty clear the type of stuff that we re gonna do and not right I mean we we do things that involve people sharing information with other people Anything that involves  John That s pretty broad   No laughs But but but anything that involves content or specific expertise in in the area So games is is I think a a really deep area Music movies TV news like any 00 22 00 media thing e commerce like any of the stuff  John You gonna wanna stay away from those movies   Like it s um  John Oh now I get that Um laughs   I wasn t sure where you re going with that  John Um I had to get it in somewhere you know   Whatever it s it s all good laughs I I think that over the next five years those verticals are all gonna be completely rethought and there gonna be some really good businesses built And some of them will be incumbents than than corporate social functionality and some of them will be new startups thinking it from scratch  Tim Um take that uh music makes me think   Sorry I I didn t actually get back to your ads thing at the end But th th the two sentence link at the end there  John Yeah    With our views that w we should play role in in helping to reform and and rethink all of those industries and we ll get value proportional to what we put in right So in gaming we get some percentage of the value of those companies largely um through their transactions through buying ads and and credits right now But that s all because we re helping them right And if we are helpful to other industries in building out um what would be a good solution for e commerce or anything like that then I think that there will be some way that we ll get value from that  Tim But   But I don t think about you know exporting an ad system or anything like that any anytime soon  Tim But there s sort of a a segue here uh whether it s advertising or not there s two models for you to exploit your platform And one is uh you know demonstrated by something like Zynga They re on Facebook The other is you re exporting your social knowledge your social graph out to other sites Even if it s not advertising you could for example imagine uh Facebook as an engine for social commerce that s available to many many start ups   Mm hmm affirmative  Tim  Off Facebook or you can say No no What we re really gonna do is we re gonna build social selling into Facebook You can imagine you know Facebook Places Well it s build in to Facebook versus you could have been an an enabler for many many location based startups How do you decide uh on the inbound platform versus the outbound platform aspect of what you do Uh because social enabling uh other people 00 24 00 is a really really powerful capability that you have   Yeah so I guess we think it s gonna happen to all these places Earlier on eve even six months ago I I kind of thought of this distinction between there s canvass inside of Facebook and there is Connect if you wanna build outside of Facebook But recently our thinking has come around to You know actually they re just kinda different things and in in a lot of ways it makes sense for people to do both There an and in addition to a mobile app and and mobile web app and like lots of different types of apps right I mean one of the things that I think is  Tim But it s something you wanted to make a social music app You know you can say we re gonna have social music in Facebook You know or you could say we re gonna help Google It is not your best friend Um you know compete with Apple You know because Apple has a pretty good music product They re trying to make it social   Mm hmm Affirmative  Tim Um but hey you know if Anybody for that matter who wanted to have a better music product could partner with you if you were in the partnering mood or you can say No we re gonna build our own music product I mean so which is it   Oh I I mean our default is just build an open platform right  Tim Mm hmm Affirmative   I mean th the stuff that we work on like groups location messages are like really core parts in in either distribution channels or  Tim Mm hmm Affirmative   Wh What we view are kind of foundational building blocks of of the Social Graph right Um  Tim Okay that s a really pretty clear distinction to make   Right An and That s like Th That s how we think about it right  Tim Yeah   I mean anything that doesn t have to be built by us we would rather not be built by us But anything that uh Just because we we were pretty small company and have like few hundred engineers right But like you know I I mean I think it s small Um laughs  John Yeah It s growing um laughs  Tim But in gene And general point is that that you see a fairly uh robust partnering strategy for Facebook as part of your future   Yeah  Tim As oppose to We re gonna try it harder   I think I think this is a big I mean this is one of the defining things I think about 00 26 00 more strategy but also our version for what the web and And and really mobile should look like right We fundamentally are not gonna build all these things ourselves But if you re Google or you re Apple and you re like Okay we want a music solution in our kind of ecosystem We want a cloud music solution or we want music on on iPhone They build those things themselves for the most part  Tim Or required   Or strategy Yeah Or or required but bring it in right And our view is mostly Okay this this should be more decentralized right Why not empower a really good entrepreneur to go build their own company Um give them all the incentive around building a great company or probably get a lot more innovation that way Um and make it so that they can integrate social dynamics into their product extremely deeply designing around people not make it a traditional music application for example And we figure it will blow everything else out of the water  John Interesting I I am curious uh a as i in that model I think that you re getting to the point with Facebook and I m sure you feel it Um where some people just don t trust you because they feel you have too much power You That you ve That you ve pretty much cornered the market on the social graph It s one ring to rule them all and and you ve got the ring Um and laughs And did you feel that pressure yet Because I get this I certainly feel it when I have conversations with entrepreneurs They re like they they have to make a decision Do I or do I not integrate with Facebook And do you believe that there really is just one social graph or is there room We have Jeff Weiner here tomorrow from LinkedIn wh who believes he s got a very powerful sort of vertical social graph around with LinkedIn Um and and Twitter believes that it has a very powerful sort of interest graph o or uh you know So there are different sort of socially social type graphs but you know and you As far as I know you re still not integrated with Ping right With Apple   I don t think yet  John No not yet Um I know you guys have been having um talks about that or had talks 00 28 00 about that But is is you know do you feel that pressure of of of of power   Well I mean it s interesting I I think you share the criticism that you re talking about or th the sentiments they are talking about It s like Woah do we want go all in and build a social app Um but at the same time the apps that have done the best are the ones that have gone all in right I mean one of the things that s defining about the games so far on on Facebook is when you A a lot of these companies that are building games they go in and develop an app assuming that every single one of their users is gonna be socially enabled  John Right   You know now it s through Facebook But I mean But I think Zynga today announced that they re doing something with Yahoo right I think that this this kinda well spread out and that s good Um so I just think it s a different modality of thinking right If if if you go in building an app expecting that people are gonna be there with their friends and expecting a social experience then you re building a fundamentally different thing than if that s the not the expectation or if only a few percent of your users are doing that  John Yes   So in some ways I actually think we re only now entering the zone where a lot of the best entrepreneurs will consider working with us Now that we ve achieved the scale  John Interesting    But now a large enough percentage of their users will be using Facebook But I mean th this is one of the things that I think is interesting with the instant personalization program that we re doing too  John Right   But it s now You know if we done instant personalization a few years ago it wouldn t have been that interesting right Because  John Well I was beaten laughs   Because a very small I mean No  John Right It was a sort of in a way   Um I mean inter personalization is only about sharing in that you ve already said that you wanna share with everyone  John Right   But um it wouldn t have been compelling a few years ago right Because we just didn t have the user base Right I mean now if you know 60 or 70 of any given websites users are likely to be Facebook users a few years ago there would have been 10 And it s like no one is gonna design an app um assuming that 10 of their users are gonna be social It just doesn t mean anything right But now yo you can design something assuming that the vast majority of your users will be socially enabled 00 30 00 and just go in with a completely different mindset around how you build something  John Yeah That s true   Um and I just think that that s get you in more and more true And in in terms of the thing that you were asking about are there gonna be different graphs That s definitely our vision I don t think that there can ever be only one and that s why we we kinda change some of the language around how we talked about this from the social graph to the open graph right At at F8 this year And the idea there was that each of these different services kind of were mapping out their own different parts of the graph And and our view is what we should be doing is trying to facilitate making these more interoperable And it s not just all that people in the social networks either right I mean if you are Yelp you have a graph of how local restaurants and businesses fit together and the reviews of them and things like that If you are a music app you probably have a graph of how musicians map the songs and albums and things like that And these rich data sets being interoperable I think it s gonna be one of the really defining things that allows a lot of innovation over the next few years  John Tim opened the conference with a call for partnerships and interoperability Um you you ve had this sort of desktop with with Google over which we discussed um and you haven t like come to terms with Apple Sometimes the realty of PNL seems to getting away of that vision Um do you feel like that s Th that s going to be resolved Um is that a goal of yours   Which part  John Well  Tim I mean the people that you won t partner with laughs  John The people Well it s th th that it seems from the outside that you ve said no we don t wanna partner with you because that s a key point of control that we wanna hold to ourselves Um   I think that we would crosstalk 00 31 41  John In other words I don t wanna build that by Apple social brand   Yeah  John That s threatening to my business right   Oh I don t think I don t think  John There s hundreds of millions of users with hundreds of millions of credit cards and if they get their social graph and   I don t I don t think we look at that way  John You don t think about that that way   I mean we we do have this thing where for very large companies we are building out Like we build our tens of 00 32 00 millions of dollars of infrastructure to support the games that are on Facebook  John Right   Right So I mean w we have this thing earlier this year where we kinda sat down with with Zynga and a bunch of th the lead developers cough and said Okay we don t have any formal relationship but you re each I mean you guys are all investing a huge amount of building on top of Facebook and want um more stable uh resources from us We want them know that we re building out all these infrastructure for you that that s gonna be stable So we should have a relationship An and we formalize that And I think that s been pretty healthy so far  John Yeah   Um so that s all that we require is you know I mean for for any you know any college student or any entrepreneur who s starting something from scratch come use our tools Um we don t require any relationship  John Right   If you re a very large company and supporting you is gonna cost us tens of millions of dollars then we want to at least to have an understanding of how you re gonna use what we re doing and that you re not just gonna import the data but also try to contribute back to the ecosystem and make people s Facebook experience better Um and I think we we re working through that to different extents with the different companies  John Right I mean you re all working with very much larger companies A as I recall uh uh in May uh Steve said Steve Jobs said that th the demands that Facebook made were just just crazy and and and  Tim Only Steve gets to make those kind of demands  John Only Steve gets to make those demands laugh Um cough uh wh what was your response when you heard that   It s fine laughs I mean look he here is my view I I I think we do a lot with Apple So I I haven t These things don t always have to start big right I mean you can you can start small and build some great stuff Um my view as I said before is that I think over the next five years almost every major product verticals gonna rethought to be social Get on the bus right Like y you re either gonna be like y you re either gonna have a an incumbent um who embraces this 00 34 00 Like Apple is doing right An an and trying to push into social stuff um i in to their in into iTunes and that will be good Or there will be some really creative entrepreneur with great engineers who are building and rethinking the experience from scratch And um I just think it s gonna be a really exciting period to see how this plays out right I think some of these are gonna be incumbents that are that are very um versatile able to rotate their business and and and make things more social and design around people Some aren t gonna be able to make it and there s an amazing opportunity I think for new entrepreneurs to build um to build new applications and rethink a lot of verticals But I think over the next five years there s gonna just be this opportunity and everyone is gonna have to think about this kind of in the same way that they are about mobile right I mean you can t  John Right   But there s no way that five years out or even three years out any major company isn t isn t thinking about how their interact with with phones  John Right    In a in a mobile environment And um I think people will get there and they just need to I think take those steps th that make them comfortable to understand how valuable it is and understand how to integrate it An and I think a slow approach is ne necessarily a bad one  John Right We we re gonna take a few questions We certainly don t wanna um you know stop without doing that So you guys know where the mics are They re right here  Tim I ll ask one other question before we get Uh p people should start coming up But Facebook is still relatively young company Uh one of the things that we see as companies get bigger it s harder to maintain the culture How much do you think about that uh at Facebook You know to You know to build the DNA cough uh into the culture   I mean everyday right  Tim But concretely what do you about it   Well so I think when you re building a company you can You can pick a few behaviors that you want your company to have that are different from other companies and that s like the personality of the company And um so we have th these values that we write down right And there are five 00 36 00 of them that we write down Um th the two that I d focus right now that I just really try to hammer home everyday are move fast and be bold right And take risks And um you know technology companies are interesting because a lot of companies get stronger with scale Like Coca Cola the bigger it gets the bigger its distribution network gets the stronger it is Um technology companies have some scale advantages but also they re just trying to get slower right And then they get replaced by smaller companies that are more versatile So one of the things that I just think about everyday is how could we make this company operate as quickly as possible right And often that s that s kind of encouraging people to move quickly Um but a lot of it is just about building out really good infrastructure that enables people to to move quickly on top of solid obstructions that we built And um that s a really big deal I think right I mean because if you think about it You know a company with a few hundred engineers putting out the number and and quality of the products that we do I think it s pretty I mean I m really proud of it I mean that s that s I think one of the main things th that I m really proud of Well I mean looking back over the past few months and you know seeing like just all the awesome stuff and in my opinion at least that we ve that we ve launched right I mean messages yesterday and then the location platform and the places deal and uh deals and single sign on and places just before that and groups and all the photos improvements and um you know just to name a few Th that s like that s pretty good Where so some And I I just think kind of encouraging small teams to move quickly um take big risks Um it s better to a risk to do something cough big and try and fail you don t need to get everything right But um better crosstalk 00 37 39  Tim Is that chance to influence things and make things happen part of why you guys are second in talent from other companies Or what s your You know what s wh what s your magic or Besides the you know the you know the fact that you re on the upwards growth   I mean I think that really good people have this way of seeking out what is the most 00 38 00 impactful position for them to be in right And you know for a long time we ve had this We have this um ratio that we measure internally which is the number of users divided by the number of engineers at Facebook And Facebook I think is one of the only companies  Tim The number with a lot of zeros laughing   Well it it s been more than a million right More than a million um users per per engineer at the company for a while And um and I I mean it s interesting because I mean if you think about the spectrum right You can be a tiny startup where you have like all this creativity and all this flexibility but you don t really have any users yet So from that perspective the leverage is fairly low To the other end where you re like a Google or a Microsoft or basically of all the users right Yo you re you re a mature company in your in your space but you also have you know ten thousand engineers or in Microsoft s case tens of thousands to leverage There is pretty There s pretty limits So if you flooded out the graph it would basically be something like this where Facebook would be like right in that golden period right now  Tim I see   And um and I just think like really talented people have just a knack for being able to find and seek out um what the positions are where they re gonna have the most leverage So it s just It s it s interesting I mean that s all different kinds of people If we would just go through the the messages team from yesterday it s just all different folks right Um the engineering director on it this guy Buzz um who s someone He was my TF at Harvard Um and and I He was the one of the first people to join the company So he s been here for about five years now Um the engineering manager joined us He was a platform developer building a classifieds app on top of Facebook and he joined us because he wanted to be a part of the company that was actually building the platform Um the lead designer on the project joined us as an intern Um and we we realize that there s management presentations where interns come and talk to the management team about what they did that summer And like I remember I like asked them some questions and he would just like went off on me and had like all these awesome points about why I was wrong about my criticism of this project and and feedback So I was like All right this guy is awesome We re definitely hiring him when he graduates Um laughs  John Why did you wait till he graduated 00 40 00 then laughs It didn t really stopped you   Yeah well It s a good question He was actually I think he was a sophomore at the time He came back for um for one more internship before he joined us full time Um the guy who built the whole iPhone version of messages um joined us through a talent acquisition right The zin bee 00 40 18 team Um this guy Will A really talented dude He he build the whole thing basically by himself Um you know th the back end right To build this stuff I m just uh like a few guys leading the team doing that I mean these are opportunities that you just don t get in a lot places right No matter what your background is or you know how you came to us or what you re what you are trying to think about doing like it s I don t know I think it s a really exciting place to be right now  Tim We should go to the audience  John We need to get the questions now Before you guys answer your questions no lectures Okay No long questions We have a lot of these so we want to get them rapid fire  Speaker 4 Um Mark I think it s fair to say that you re a celebrity entrepreneur and I think it s also fair to say that the public perception of you is one of a computationally minded sort of rational and logical entrepreneur But maybe you can talk a little about what it s like to be young and so far ahead of so many other founders and entrepreneurs and CEO s and talk about the effect that s had on you as a person Uh and maybe some of the lessons you ve had to learn in your shoes   I mean I think Oh man I I just made I made so many mistakes in running the company so far I mean like basically any mistake that you think you can make I probably made or will make laughs Um In the next few years  John There s time laughs   Yeah Uh uh but I don t know I think if anything The Facebook story is a great example of how if you re building a product that people love you can make a lot of mistakes  John Nice   Um and and I think that s like And I don t know It s I I just think 00 42 00 that the lesson to other folks from that is focus on building something that people really like and that s very valuable and Um you know one of our board members always at at our board members At at our board meetings used to make this um whenever we d be analyzing a problem he would say You know there s there s a hundred problems that you have to deal with right now but only one or two of them probably really matter right Um so just ignore the rest and put all your effort into into focusing on a couple of things that really matter Um and I I just think that for almost any industry or product that that you re in it it s just all about building products that people like right And like If you do that you can do so much other stuff wrong and and like learn from that and and fix those mistakes over time and like still end up at a reasonable place and I don t know So I mean I I think that like we still make mistakes all the time I mean take for example the con the conversation we were having earlier about um you know the contact importer stuff and you know contact syncing Like do I know that we re on the right place No I think we re doing the best that we can right now Um and we we wake up everyday trying to build a great product for people that that s res that s responsive to to what they ve asked us for So  Speaker 4 Great  Speaker 5 Mark here s that education My 15 year old daughter Holly Jeffs studies with Facebook in full gear She is interacting with her friends while studying With the first couple of years I thought this is a total destruction but her grades are actually pretty good So it must be working and it made me think do you think of education as an opportunity area for Facebook You know corporate uh Facebook pages are fine but how about uh i is that an area that you think of building applications and services for   Sorry I didn t hear the end of that The echo is crosstalk 00 43 38  John  crosstalk 00 43 38 The question is that do you think education is an opportunity in terms of building applications or or services on  Tim For making education social  Speaker 5 It s inherently social activity   Yeah You know I ve spent a lot of time over the last year researching education And um you know one of the One of the issues and one of the reasons why I um ended up 00 44 00 choosing to get involved with that outside of Facebook is that on one of the One of the issues is you can actually sign up for Facebook until you re 13 right Unless you have your parent s permission But basically like it s it s not very well adapted in under 13 so that kinda cuts out a lot of th the time when people are developing But yeah I mean I I think that a lot of the problems in education are are technology around efficiently sharing things Um and if you could if if someone could build a good application that got people engaged um then I think there s a big opportunity there And one analogy is kind of enterprise software to consumer software I think a lot of enterprise software gets developed from this mindset of like I want a feature checklist right Rather than like what is really good to use right And um and I think that s one of the reasons why a lot of communication tools are going from you know like a lot of communication that we do now it goes over IM right It s not owned by by whatever company um companies IT department yo you re operating under It s a consumer product that people are using legitimately to do work And the reason why they do that is because it s enjoyable to use And I I think the same is gonna be true in a lot of um like kind of traditionally non consumer areas right Not only enterprise but I think things like education as well where traditionally they are just The software hasn t been like as great to use as um as kind of th the best consumer software But I think that there s an opportunity now for people to do that and create great socially designed products and I don t know I I think we ll see it  John But we should keep going here  Tim Yeah we got to keep going  John We re moving here inaudible 00 45 36 guys  Speaker 6 Hi Hassel 00 45 38 from the Netherlands I m your biggest fan of Facebook Um in the last few years I ve been advocating to my customers or potentialcustomers that social business social commerce should be in Facebook and that any W you know website can be in Facebook I believe that you guys can do billions of revenues Do you agree with that 00 46 00  John Can you do billions in revenues and particularly where as I understand  Speaker 6 Commerce and business No more commerce and business not just advertisement   Sorry the echo is very tough  John Yeah uh it s hard to understand through the echo I m sorry  Speaker 6 So now your business is about advertisements right You help you re helping social gaming but no more businesses If they sell stuff they can do through Facebook  John Commerce yes  Speaker 6 Commerce yeah  John So is commerce is a big area and social commerce is one of the crosstalk 00 46 30   This is this is I mean what I was trying to say in response to you before but I actually never got back to your question u until the end with one sentence But what social applications have is they are just much more engaging right Because you have the choice of either I mean going back to like th the music example or the games example You could either um you know play a game or play a game where the dynamics involve playing it with your friends You could either play music or you can see what your friends like to listen too through playlist and discover new stuff through that And I think what you find is that these social apps when they re executed well are a lot more engaging right And they are just enjoyable for people to use Now that creates a lot of opportunities for people to monetize them and build great businesses right I mean whether it s advertising or you know commerce buying things or subscriptions I think those are kind of the classical business models But there might be other things that people come up with as well I I just think that it all starts with building a product that people love And when you execute the social product well I think we have shown that you can extend that to many many verticals Maybe any vertical and make it so that it becomes a a great product that s crosstalk 47 42 in order of magnitude more engaging than than anything else  John If I m Andre Mason at at GroupOn or Susan Lyne at Gilt she was here Should I be worried about Facebook deals combined with location places Should I be worried that you re eating my lunch   No I mean I think we wanna work with them I mean 00 48 00 it s a deal platform  John Right   But it s not uh I mean they are they are business there Uh I mean they are out selling all those deals  John Right   And I mean we don t have a crosstalk 00 48 08 sales force that s focused on selling those deals  John Yeah Right  Speaker 6 How much commission will you take laughs  John How much commission will you take   I don t know You wanna just pick a number laughs It s dangerous  John Uh this is Ari Emanuel s answer last night which is Fair is where you end up laughs Over here  Julianne Hi Julianne Pepitone with CNN Um I reported earlier today on a bug inFacebook that deleted some users account saying that they were in violation of terms of service when in fact they were legitimate accounts I was wondering if you have any further information on that and whether it s at all related to Facebook s messaging system and if you re concerned about those kinds of bugs for the messaging system going forward   Yeah uh I don t have any new information on that I apologize to those users for that Um my understanding that was that it was a bug It was not related to messages Um it s unfortunate but I think we were able to get them all back on the site  John Great Over here  Francois Hi My name is Francois at inaudible 00 49 16 And so Fa Facebook uh move 500 um friends million friends uh into the cloud Uh what would trigger 500 million small business to move to the cloud with Facebook   A little help  John Di you say Oh you wanted that   I need a translator for this side of the room laughs  John Uh uh he said He said 500 million people are are on um the platform How could you get 500 million businesses on the platform Is that  Francois It s correct  John Yes Where you interested in in getting businesses on the platform as well as people   Yeah and I mean we have this whole pages product right That s very widely  John It s mainly focused on pretty 00 50 00 big brands isn t it   I mean I think that the biggest brands have the biggest followings But  John Right   And there s uh I I don t know I don t want to give a name credit starts But th there s a lot of pages that are small businesses or different entities um th that that are pretty small Um  John Are you interested in the business social graph I got to ask because Jeff Weiner is coming tomorrow and I m sure   Oh business social graph you mean professional connections between people  John Or between business I m asking because he asked   I don t know what that means Um  John Well businesses do business with each other all the time and   Yeah chuckle  Tim Okay move it along   Yeah  John Thank you for the question I feel to translating it   No it s cool It s I I mean I m just having a hard time hearing on on this side of the room  Speaker 9 We have seen key functionality from Facebook move outside of Facebook to a degree You know where the API with the like button available in different pages Is it going to be Facebook as a destination in your mind or Facebook as an enabler   Well I think the first chapter has definitely been building out Facebook via application right The site that people use everyday The long term if if you buy my my vision and what would I hope plays out over the next five years of just having all these different verticals get rethought by b brilliant entrepreneurs in these different areas will be that the vast majority of the social ecosystem will not be Facebook but we will help those businesses get built right Because they re gonna be able to focus on doing what they do well right And and they can just plugin the social part And um And if we do that then then I think will be will be enabling to to your To use your words and um that I think is th the a bigger of long term opportunity Right I mean I I don t think that you know Actually I I like this map that you have up here but my first instinct was Your map is wrong laughs Because  John Of course it s wrong It s version 1 laughs   Because the 00 52 00 I think that the biggest part of the map is has got to be the uncharted territory right And I mean one of the best things crosstalk 52 06 about the technology industry is that it s not zero or something right This thing this makes it seem like it s zero or some right In order to take territory you have to be taking territory from someone else But I think on one of the best things is that it s like we re building real value in the world not just taking value from other companies And um  John Absolutely but there are a lot of companies to start and act that way applause You re totally right Yeah I think our point is yeah   So  John We see a lot of companies acting as if it is a zero some game and that seems to be framing the debate and it s refreshing to hear you say that   So I mean No that s our view I mean our view is not only that it should expand but that we should enable to expand and that our best strategy and the best thing for the web would be for us to enable the next kind of set of entrepreneurs to go build all those great businesses and discover that and not even trying to do it ourselves because I don t we can  John That s a great   I think we do a few things very well and we re gonna keep on trying to do this very well because even those things are at the beginning  Tim That s a great argument why you re gonna win laugh   If you say  John I m getting like the absolute stuff but you re so far over We have a sponsor is that   Yeah I think we re like 25  John Yeah we re we re I just I didn t you know we have a lot of people in the room I don t know how thought the live stream is probably busting the servers Um but there is a woman who s been waiting for so long Last question Make it quick  Speaker 10 Um mobile social Well right at the beginning Um can you give us some risk taking things that Facebook can do to move the space forward for us   The mobile space  Speaker 11 Mobile social   Mobile social Well I mean just a couple of weeks ago we announced um a a few things right That we thought we re kind of key building blocks for the social platform Right One was single sign on Right now it it s actually amazing how you know signing into an app and creating an account on mobile is so difficult Right I mean e even using Connect previously was was very difficult 00 54 00 because you click connect and then you had to enter your Facebook password for each e each app And it turns out that remembering your password is actually pretty difficult on mobile because it s all that muscle memory not actually remembering the string that you  John And if you re driving it s really hard laughs   Well that I won t even get to But um so you know single sign on now Um and this is I mean this is a good example of non zero or some things We weren t able to do this until recently Um yo you could on Android you could on iPhone until Apple built fast app switching And because they built that we were now able to um create this functionality where any developer can put Connect into their app and as as long you have the Facebook app you no longer need to authenticate All you do is click a button and you re in And now that app has access to your your public information They can ask you to for for other information if it wants Um that I think is a really foundational building block for good mobile apps Another is just location information I mean we aren t trying to build places the app we re trying to build places the location platform that anyone can plug into both from a read and a write perspective Um so that way your apps can all be location enabled right And not only do you know who the person s friends are but you know where they are and who s around you And that s really powerful And in the third was the deals thing which again is also a platform where th the goal was not like Okay we re gonna go sell some deals It s There should be an economic platform and engine that anyone can plug into and we want to enable that on mobile as well So under mobiles it it s a it s a really interesting space now Um you know we re I I think what we have found is you know already so many people use Facebook on mobile It s more than two hundred million mobile users But really th the mobile platform I think is just getting started and some of those type things and things like that going forward and that kind of collaboration between these different companies is gonna enable really good things over the next few years  John Well please join me in thanking mark for taking so much of his time applause Thank you very much 00 56 00 '}\n",

generally more open and transparent and that people should be willing to share more stuff Inhales pause quick glance to his right But those things aren t products by themselves Right so then there actually has to be a very tactical use case that drives what people pause uh what your users are going to be doing on a day to day basis and unless you have that use case yourself inhales looks down

for this to continue happening into the future with pause technology that s eminently on the horizon inevitably you know more almost everyone is going to have a mobile phone um I you could say that s

focusing on its co founder and CEO  Clock ticking Half a billion people give you their personal information do you feel that because of that they have a right to know a lot about you personally What your values um that   Yeah I think that because of that we have to do a very good job of communicating as company really  Lesley No you I m talking about you  Is it important to know who s running Facebook in the light of that   Yeah yeah It is it is I mean that s  Lesley Interesting What makes Mark tick is heightened since the release of the movie The Social Network that depicts him as a callous genius who betrays friends and principles to protect his creation Facebook  Jesse You guys are the inventor of Facebook He invented Facebook  Lesley The real Mark vowed he would never see the film On opening day he changed his mind   I took the whole company to go see the movie  Lesley The whole com that   I mean I actually thought it was pretty fun  Lesley But my guess my question is was it hard to watch for you   When watching it s pretty interesting to see what parts they got right and what parts they got wrong I think that they got every single t shirt that they had the  character wearing right Laughs I think I actually own those t shirts Um and they got the sandals right and all that but laughs 00 02 00 I mean there are hugely basic things that they got wrong too I mean they made it seem like um like my whole motivation for building Facebook was so I could get girls right and they completely left out the fact that my girlfriend I ve been dating since before I started Facebook right So I m not just like  Lesley Wait what Say that again the girl your current girlfriend you were dating back then   Yeah I ve been dating my current girlfriend  Lesley During the time of the movie   since before I created Facebook Yeah I mean and yeah  Lesley You know I ve heard two reactions One is about you very personally and that s not so flattering The other is that Wow he is a really great entrepreneur   I get two reactions too but they re actually a little bit different from the ones that you said There s a set of people who I think have been following the Facebook story who I think were had a deeper analysis of which things in the movie were true and which ones were false and all that For the rest of people I just think we re pretty surprised and even amazed that like Wow Facebook is an interesting enough thing to make a movie out of or this  person I never heard of him like this must be interesting and I can t tell you how many messages I ve gotten from people who use Facebook writing in to say This movie was really inspiring to me After seeing this movie I wanna start a company or I wanna go in to computer science or I wanna study math and if the movie had that effect on people then awesome right Laughs I mean that s great  Lesley You almost sounded enthusiastic about this movie laughs   That That part  Lesley That part Laughing That part then    Laughs  Male When you said you had this idea  Lesley One part he doesn t like has to do with the Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron  Male Excuse us for inviting you in  Lesley In real life they re Olympic rowers who claimed that when they were at Harvard they had the idea of a university based social networking site first Then in 2003 Mark agreed to work on their project but instead they say 00 04 00 He ripped them off  Male When we approached him we had been working on the idea for almost a year at that point We had a sophisticated code base It wasn t an idea scribbled on a napkin It was a very sort of mature idea and we brought him on to bring it to completion  Male We agreed to work on this project He sabotaged our project and he betrayed us  Lesley There were other social networking sites already there It isn t as if you had the first idea right You admit that  Male Well that s a that s a typical argument that comes from Facebook that social networking existed at the time  Lesley Right  Male We weren t individuals on separate side of the country developing social networks unbeknownst to each other We were teammates We were partners  Lesley So how did you actually find out that he was working on a different project  Male We found out by reading the Harvard student newspaper  Lesley So that s the first you realized  Male Yup  Lesley What did the article say  Male It said to the effect  launches theFacebook com It described a bit about it We turned to each other and we said Isn t that the  that s working with us on the same project  Lesley So they sued and in 2008 the case was settled out of court for a reported 65 million but the twins have since appealed arguing that Facebook misled them about the value of the stock in the settlement Why are you pounding away at this when you re making so much money  Male This is all about principle We  Lesley Well I have to be honest with you It doesn t look that way Laughs It looks like it s all about money  Male No you will have I m not sure anybody can quite put themselves in our shoes and understand what it must ve felt like to start an idea in 2002 to approach a to approach a fellow student in 2004 00 06 00 to have it stolen sabotaged ripped off  Lesley Recently leaked from instant messages reportedly from Mark s old computer suggests he did deliberately delay the twin s project  Male That he premeditatedly sandbagged us because he knew getting there first was everything There wasn t room for two social networks at Harvard and universities around the country  Lesley What do you say to people who say Come on Give the guy a break He was 19 years old  Male I know that when I was 19 I wouldn t have behaved that way I would have certainly not um betrayed fellow classmates  Lesley Okay Big question are you guys on Facebook   Yes  Male Yeah  Lesley Get out of here Let me ask you about the Winklevoss twins They sued You settled   Mm hmm  Lesley They re still coming after you   You know it s hard for me to fully wrap my head around where they re coming from on this Um you know early on they had an idea that was completely separate from Facebook and that it was a dating site for Harvard and um and I agreed to help them out with it to help them I mean it wasn t a job They weren t paying me I wasn t hired by them or anything like that and then the idea that you know I would then go work on something completely different like Facebook and that they would be upset about this all of these years later is kinda mind boggling for me You know I mean this is another thing that I think the movie really missed is and they make it seem like this whole lawsuit is such a huge part of Facebook s history I probably spent less than two weeks of my time worried about this lawsuit at all right I mean  Lesley You should have worried about it early on laughs   I should have early on right  Lesley Yeah   But I guess the point that I m trying to make is this has never been a big deal to Facebook or its evolution  Lesley Do do you feel any any remorse at all about the 00 08 00 twins or anything that happened with them   I mean after all this time I feel bad that they still feel bad about it  Lesley Kara Swisher editor of the website about high tech said she doesn t feel sorry for the twins  Kara I m sorry they got paid 65 million for one medium idea but they never could have made it into anything like  Lesley Well you sound very sympathetic to Mark as an individual to me  Kara In this case yes because he is the entrepreneur I mean I think he definitely um uh tried to screw with the Winklevoss that s clear He promised to do a service for them He didn t do He did but he also did build the business without their help  Lesley You are famous for coining the term toddler CEO laughs  Kara I am  Lesley about   Kara I did laughs  Lesley Um that was three years ago and you told us that you thought he was inexperienced and way too young to run this company  Kara Yes  Lesley Three years later  Kara He s done a great job He s a prodigy The toddler s a prodigy as it turns out  Lesley When I was here three years ago they were calling you the toddler CEO and they don t say that anymore at all This is a tough question but try   Mm hmm  Lesley How would you grade yourself as a CEO as the leader of this business   I mean that is a hard question  Lesley That s a hard question   I also don t think you can ever win by answering that question Laughs and that we ve made a huge number of mistakes along the way Right now I always say I just think we ve made probably every possible mistake we could make  Lesley Is there a decision that you ve made that the people around you uh told you was a mistake and you defied them and you were right   You know and the most famous one I think probably has to do with selling the company right I mean in 2006 we had this opportunity to sell the company to Yahoo for a billion dollars and we turned that down I think a lot of people at the time felt that we should sell the company  Lesley Absolutely   but you know I felt really strongly and I 00 10 00 think like now people generally think that that was a good decision  Lesley Since that decision the company has grown considerably Estimates are that if there were an unusual public stock offering an IPO today Facebook would be valued between 35 and 50 billion dollars Are you ever going to have the IPO ever   You know maybe  Lesley It s like you can t let go   I can t let go  Lesley You can t let go   I don t think it s letting go Here this is the way that I think about it a lot of people who I think build startups or companies think that selling the company or going public is this endpoint right So you win when you go public and that s just not how I see it  Lesley You re 26 years old   Yeah  Lesley Do you chuckles feel old   Yeah  Lesley  Laughs yeah Running this giant company um your personal worth is said to be 6 9 billion do you ever just pinch yourself Do you ever just say Wow this happened to me   I mean it is pretty crazy  Clock ticking  Male Go to 60minutesOvertime com for a guided tour of the Facebook redesign that launches tomorrow Sponsored by Pfizer

      "{'filename': '2011-022', 'content': '  My post this morning on our commitment to the Facebook community I m committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy Note Our Commitment to the Facebook CommunityBy Slater Tow on Tuesday November 29 2011 at 9 39amI founded Facebook on the idea that people want to share and connect with people in their lives but to do this everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times This idea has been the core of Facebook since day one When I built the first version of Facebook almost nobody I knew wanted a public page on the internet That seemed scary But as long as they could make their page private they felt safe sharing with their friends online Control was key With Facebook for the first time people had the tools they needed to do this That s how Facebook became the world s biggest community online We made it easy for people to feel comfortable sharing things about their real lives We ve added many new tools since then sharing photos creating groups commenting on and liking your friends posts and recently even listening to music or watching videos together With each new tool we ve added new privacy controls to ensure that you continue to have complete control over who sees everything you share Because of these tools and controls most people share many more things today than they did a few years ago Overall I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information That said I m the first to admit that we ve made a bunch of mistakes In particular I think that a small number of high profile mistakes like Beacon four years ago and poor execution as we transitioned our privacy model two years ago have often overshadowed much of the good work we ve done I also understand that many people are just naturally skeptical of what it means for hundreds of millions of people to share so much personal information online especially using any one service Even if our record on privacy were perfect I think many people would still rightfully question how their information was protected It s important for people to think about this and not one day goes by when I don t think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust Facebook has always been committed to being transparent about the information you have stored with us and we have led the internet in building tools to give people the ability to see and control what they share But we can also always do better I m committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy As we have grown we have tried our best to listen closely to the people who use Facebook We also work with regulators advocates and experts to inform our privacy practices and policies Recently the US Federal Trade Commission established agreements with Google and Twitter that are helping to shape new privacy standards for our industry Today the FTC announced a similar agreement with Facebook These agreements create a framework for how companies should approach privacy in the United States and around the world For Facebook this means we re making a clear and formal long term commitment to do the things we ve always tried to do and planned to keep doing giving you tools to control who can see your information and then making sure only those people you intend can see it In the last 18 months alone we ve announced more than 20 new tools and resources designed to give you more control over your Facebook experience Some of the things these include are  An easier way to select your audience when making a new post Inline privacy controls on all your existing posts The ability to review tags made by others before they appear on your profile Friend lists that are easier to create and that maintain themselves automatically A new groups product for sharing with smaller sets of people A tool to view your profile as someone else would see it Tools to ensure your information stays secure like double login approval Mobile versions of your privacy controls An easy way to download all your Facebook data A new apps dashboard to control what your apps can access A new app permission dialog that gives you clear control over what an app can do anytime you add one Many more privacy education resourcesAs a matter of fact privacy is so deeply embedded in all of the development we do that every day tens of thousands of servers worth of computational resources are consumed checking to make sure that on any webpage we serve that you have access to see each of the sometimes hundreds or even thousands of individual pieces of information that come together to form a Facebook page This includes everything from every post on a page to every tag in those posts to every mutual friend shown when you hover over a person s name We do privacy access checks literally tens of billions of times each day to ensure we re enforcing that only the people you want see your content These privacy principles are written very deeply into our code Even before the agreement announced by the FTC today Facebook had already proactively addressed many of the concerns the FTC raised For example their complaint to us mentioned our Verified Apps Program which we canceled almost two years ago in December 2009 The same complaint also mentions cases where advertisers inadvertently received the ID numbers of some users in referrer URLs We fixed that problem over a year ago in May 2010 In addition to these product changes the FTC also recommended improvements to our internal processes We ve embraced these ideas too by agreeing to improve and formalize the way we do privacy review as part of our ongoing product development process As part of this we will establish a biennial independent audit of our privacy practices to ensure we re living up to the commitments we make Even further effective today I am creating two new corporate officer roles to make sure our commitments will be reflected in what we do internally in the development of our products and the security of our systems and externally in the way we work collaboratively with regulators government agencies and privacy groups from around the world  Erin Egan will become Chief Privacy Officer Policy Erin recently joined Facebook after serving as a partner and co chair of the global privacy and data security practice of Covington Burling the respected international law firm Throughout her career Erin has been deeply involved in legislative and regulatory efforts to address privacy data security spam spyware and other consumer protection issues Erin will lead our engagement in the global public discourse and debate about online privacy and ensure that feedback from regulators legislators experts and academics from around the world is incorporated into Facebook s practices and policies  Michael Richter will become Chief Privacy Officer Products Michael is currently Facebook s Chief Privacy Counsel on our legal team In his new role Michael will join our product organization to expand improve and formalize our existing program of internal privacy review He and his team will work to ensure that our principles of user control privacy by design and transparency are integrated consistently into both Facebook s product development process and our products themselves These two positions will further strengthen the processes that ensure that privacy control is built into our products and policies I m proud to have two such strong individuals with so much privacy expertise serving in these roles Today s announcement formalizes our commitment to providing you with control over your privacy and sharing and it also provides protection to ensure that your information is only shared in the way you intend As the founder and CEO of Facebook I look forward to working with the Commission as we implement this agreement It is my hope that this agreement makes it clear that Facebook is the leader when it comes to offering people control over the information they share online Finally I also want to reaffirm the commitment I made when I first launched Facebook We will serve you as best we can and work every day to provide you with the best tools for you to share with each other and the world We will continue to improve the service build new ways for you to share and offer new ways to protect you and your information better than any other company in the world '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2012-003', 'content': '  Here s some interesting weekend reading There has been a lot of discussion recently about whether social networks give you a more diverse perspective on the world through helping you see more people s opinions or whether they re more of an echo chamber that just reinforces your opinions since the people you share with probably have similar opinions to your own The latest research shows that social networks tend to give you a more diverse perspective because even though your close ties may have similar opinions to yours the vast majority of information you see comes from weaker ties who tend to have a more diverse opinions This seems right to me Our mission is to make the world more open and connected Making the world more open means more information and perspective is available Making the world more connected means people are exposed to more of those perspectives through the connections they re able to maintain That s why I love what we re doing Note Rethinking Information Diversity in NetworksBy Eytan Bakshy on Tuesday January 17 2012 at 8 00amHow do your friends shape the information you see and read online Social networking technologies like Facebook let us connect to hundreds even thousands of people and have fundamentally changed how people get their information While much of our time is spent communicating with close friends about events in our personal lives 1 we also use online networks to share breaking news discuss political issues and learn about new trends In 2010 my colleagues Itamar Rosenn Cameron Marlow Lada Adamic and I conducted a study on Facebook to understand the nature of information spread in social networks Some claim that social networks act like echo chambers in which people only consume and share information from likeminded close friends stifling the spread of diverse information Our study paints a different picture of the world Instead we found that even though people are more likely to consume and share information that comes from close conts that they interact with frequently like discussing a photo from last night s party the vast majority of information comes from contacts that they interact with infrequently These distant contacts are also more likely to share novel information demonstrating that social networks can act as a powerful medium for sharing new ideas highlighting new products and discussing current events The research suggests that Facebook isn t the echo chamber that some might expect online social networks may actually increase the spread of novel information and diverse viewpoints Social Networks as Information PathwaysEconomic sociologist Mark Granovetter was one of the first to popularize the use of social networks in understanding the spread of information In his seminal 1973 paper The Strength of Weak Ties 2 Granovetter found that surprisingly people are more likely to acquire jobs that they learned about through individuals they interact with infrequently rather than their close personal contacts To explain this phenomenon Granovetter used social graphs to illustrate how networks relate to information access Figure 1 When a person interacts with two individuals frequently those individuals are also likely to interact with one another It follows that people tend to form dense clusters of strong ties who are all connected Figure 1 We are connected to core groups of strong ties that we interact with frequently and weak ties that we interact with infrequently Granovetter s hypothesis about the strength of weak ties states that weak ties facilitate information flow from disparate clusters of people Figure 1 We are connected to core groups of strong ties that we interact with frequently and weak ties that we interact with infrequently Granovetter s hypothesis about the strength of weak ties states that weak ties facilitate information flow from disparate clusters of people What do these structures have to do with information access Since people in these clusters all know each other y information that is available to one individual spreads quickly to others within the cluster These tight knit social circles tend to be small relative to people s entire social network and when it comes to information about future job opportunities it can be hard to find new leads Granovetter used the relationship between interaction frequency and social structure to explain why information about jobs is instead found through weak ties that we interact with infrequently Weak ties help spread novel information by bridging the gap between clusters of strong tie contacts The strength of weak ties informs much of the popular understanding of information spread in social networks Birds of a Feather Surf TogetherBut what about information that is more widely available like news on the Internet To understand the flow of more general types of information in society it s important not only to take into account how people are connected but also the commonalities that promote the spread of information One of the most robust findings in social networks is that of homophily 3 the tendency of individuals with similar characteristics to associate with one another Individuals are connected to each other through workplaces professions schools clubs hobbies political beliefs and other affiliations The homophily principle holds true for any kind of social network you can think of close friends professional contacts classmates and even the people you ride the bus with Today these commonalities not only shape how often people interact and what they talk about but also what kinds of information they as individuals seek on the Web Homophily suggests that people who interact frequently are similar and may consume more of the same information Individuals that interact less often tend to be dissimilar and may consume more diverse information This view of the world is illustrated in Figure 2 below Figure 2 Information spread in online social networks Our study suggests that strong ties are similar and more likely to be tuned into the same web sites Weak ties being more dissimilar tend to visit different websites Figure 2 Information spread in online social networks Our study suggests that strong ties are similar and more likely to be tuned into the same web sites Weak ties being more dissimilar tend to visit different websites Interest and NoveltyTo understand how online social networks affect the spread of information we used random variation in the News Feed to determine how likely a person is to share Web content if she did or did not see the content shared by her friends We found that people are more likely to share the information they were exposed to by their strong ties than by their weak ties on Facebook Figure 3 Figure 3 People are more likely to share information links to Web pages that they were exposed to by strong ties in their News Feed 4 Tie strength between two individuals is measured by the number of comments a person received from their friend on Facebook Other measurements of tie strength like the number of messages co appearances in photos and discussion on posts are discussed in our paper 5 Figure 3 People are more likely to share information links to Web pages that they were exposed to by strong ties in their News Feed 4 Tie strength between two individuals is measured by the number of comments a person received from their friend on Facebook Other measurements of tie strength like the number of messages co appearances in photos and discussion on posts are discussed in our paper 5 There are many possible explanations for the increased flow of information across strong ties One reason is that close contacts are more likely to be similar to one another and therefore find content shared by their close friends more interesting An alternative explanation is that strong ties are more influential so that people are more likely to be persuaded to share information from their close contacts We also investigate how Facebook plifies information distribution That is if a friend shares something on Facebook how many times more likely are you to share that information as a result of seeing it in the News Feed The figure below shows how this multiplicative effect depends on the strength of your tie with that friend Figure 4 Weak ties spread novel information that people are unlikely to otherwise see The figure above shows how many times more likely people are to share a page because of exposure via the News Feed from strong and weak ties Figure 4 Weak ties spread novel information that people are unlikely to otherwise see The figure above shows how many times more likely people are to share a page because of exposure via the News Feed from strong and weak ties We found that information shared by a person s weak ties is unlikely to be shared at a later point in time independently of those friends Therefore seeing content from a weak tie leads to a nearly tenfold increase in the likelihood that a person will share a in In contrast seeing information shared by a strong tie in News Feed makes people just six times as likely to share In short weak ties have the greatest potential to expose their friends to information that they would not have otherwise discovered The Collective Influence of Weak TiesUltimately we are interested in how these network effects shape information spread as a whole Even though a person is more likely to share a single piece of information from one of their close contacts it turns out that weak ties are collectively responsible for the majority of information spread Let s consider a hypothetical example illustrated in Figure 5 Let s say a person has 100 contacts that are weak tie friends and 10 that are strong tie friends Suppose the chance that you ll share something is very high for strong tie friends say 50 but the weak tie friends tend to share less interesting stuff so the likelihood of sharing is only 15 Therefore the amount of information spread due to weak and strong ties would be 100 0 15 15 and 10 0 50 5 respectively so in total people would end up sharing more from their weak tie friends Figure 5 People are more likely to share information from their strong ties but because of their abundance weak ties are primarily responsible for the majority of information spread on Facebook The figure above illustrates how a majority of influence orange can be generated by weak ties even if strong ties are individually more influential Figure 5 People are more likely to share information from their strong ties but because of their abundance weak ties are primarily responsible for the majority of information spread on Facebook The figure above illustrates how a majority of influence orange can be generated by weak ties even if strong ties are individually more influential It turns out that the mathematics of information spread on Facebook is quite similar to our hypothetical example the majority of people s contacts are weak tie friends and if we carry out this same computation using the empirical distribution of tie strengths and their corresponding probabilities we find that weak ties generate the majority of information spread ConclusionThe information we consume and share on Facebook is actually much more diverse in nature than conventional wisdom might suggest We are exposed to and spread more information from our distant contacts than our close friends Since these distant contacts tend to be different from us the bulk of information we consume and share comes from people with different perspectives This may provide some comfort to those who worry that social networks are simply an echo chamber where people are only exposed to those who share the same opinions Our work is among the first to rigorously quantify influence at a mass scale and shows that online social networks can serve as an important medium for sharing new perspectives products and world events Footnotes 1 Common experience would suggest that we spend most of our time communicating with only a few individuals on Facebook To a large extent this is true and documented in Backstrom et al Center of Attention How Facebook Users allocate Attention ICWSM 2011  2 M Granovetter The Strength of Weak Ties American Journal of Sociology 1973  3 An extensive and accessible introduction to homophily can be found in McPherson et al Birds of a Feather Flock Together Annual Review of Sociology 2001  4 It is important to note that very often information does not cascade very far along the network This phenomenon has been observed in earlier research on Twitter in Everyone s an Influencer Quantifying Influence on Twitter and has been studied across other networks more extensively in upcoming work by Sharad Goel and Duncan Watts at Yahoo Research NY  5 The Role of Social

that so many couldbe with us especially with such a last minute invitation Uh it just feels terrible to begin atestimonial um but I should probably address this to you Mark Before I joined Facebook I never had this group of friends before Laughter And then Ijoined Facebook and now everywhere I go they come with me laughter So we re goingshopping we go to the movies together we go to TV Um it s nice to have friends Dear friends laughter I want to tell you about Walt Disney born in 1901 Uh he lefthome at age 18 and moved to Kansas City where he moved in with his brother He was good atsketching cartoons and so he um went to the local to the local movie theater which was the onlytheater in town and said Can I draw posters for you and put them around town uh as a way ofpromoting the film And he was hired to do that and then he learned that if you could show hissketches serially they could create an animated cartoon look He moved to the West Coast to be with his brother his oldest brother who lived in LosAngeles and he went and teached in the studios and he proposed How about running theseanimated cartoon sketches in the front of movies All of the Hollywood studios took the Disneycartoons to precede all the feature films that were distributed globally At uh you know the endof a Disney cartoon where you get that iconographic signature the Disney name comes up bythe time Walt was 29 years old his name was the best known name in the 00 02 00 history ofthe world  was born in 1984 He turned 29 in May Uh his creation Facebook is uh has 1 15 billion users It is the largest connected community in the history of our species andhe lays a very honest claim to being uh the um carrying the Walt Disney mantle of our time Uh it s really a privilege for the Atlantic to be able to host him uh today To my far right is James Bennet who is the editor in chief of the Atlantic and I hope youwill join me in welcoming  Applause  James B Um thank you all for being here Mark thank you very much um might as willbegin at the beginning I understand this is your first time in DC in three years and uh I mwondering why you ve stayed away so long and uh what brings you here now   Well I try to do an annual DC trip and it just so happens that it happens aboutonce every three years laughter But you know I try to spend most of my time in running thecompany building and improving the services for our uh more than more than a billion peoplewho use Facebook worldwide And um it s a lot of people really rely on this and use it for um for a lot of their day to day connecting We now I guess the last uh numbers that we reportedwere um 699 million people um use Facebook everyday So um just I I I tend to think thatfor myself um oh the most impactful thing that I can do is improve that service for people um rather than coming here laughter But um but every once in a while it it s useful to check inand then make sure that um The purpose of this trip is actually largely for immigration morethan um more than Facebook  James B Yeah so why don t we why don t we talk about immigration for a minute Um obviously Facebook 00 04 00 has a direct interest in easing restrictions on high skillimmigrants Um and and a lot of people in your industry have been pushing for that for sometime You have refused to decouple that from the larger question of immigration reform Um and I wonder why is that   Well they re just both really important and I think um for a lot of reasons itmakes sense to do both at the same time Most of the folks who I know who run tech companies feel um the high skill part of the the issue s very acutely Right I mean we all have youknow a bunch of engineering roles that we are trying to fill and this isn t a matter of trying to um hire people instead of Americans who are doing this We ll hire all of them Right It s um It s The the issue is that there aren t enoughtalented people we can bring into the country Um that that is a real issue that people feel Um we ve been working on that for a while That that actually isn t the big point of this Um youknow I started getting into immigration uh because you know my my wife when shegraduated from from college went and became a teacher and now um she s just graduatedmedical school is is a pediatrician So our dinner topics are basically Facebook and kids And um so far I ve been successful at you know push it off and not having our own kids but um just staying focused on on our stuff but I ll I ll lose that one eventually Um but but in the inthe meantime so we do a bunch of education philanthropy work and um one day she says tome Um you know we re not just going to be and and you specifically are going to be one ofthese people who you know just write checks to different organizations but hasn t ever taughtanything yourself So she help me set up this um this classroom afterschool program in right in our localcommunity in in um East Menlo Park and California Um and I I basically taught thisafterschool program to to a bunch of kids in in the community um on entrepreneurship And itwas a really rewarding experience 00 06 00 but the thing that I took away from it was youknow one day after after school um I I asked the the students how they were thinking aboutgoing to college and my my top student raised his hand and said You know I don t know if Iam going to be able to go to college because I am undocumented And that just blew my mind because I mean he didn t look a different from anyone elsethere and um it it s like you know I think oftentimes people talk about you know high skilland comprehensive immigration reform as if they re different things You know that student isgoing to be the entrepreneur of tomorrow Right And and this is a big is a big deal so I askedthe students um you know How many of you were born outside of the country And a bunchof them put their hands up and I was just shocked right And um you know so they weren t going to be able to go to college or were going to um have issues with that They were all applying to local high schools They were worried thatthey were going to have issues there because high schools all care about their matriculation statsand don t want to let kids in or at least um somewhat biased against kids who are then notgoing to be able to get it to college as as easily Um so you know the more I look into it themore unfair this this seemed And you know Silicon Valley is a pretty idealistic place So when I went and startedtalking to a lot of my friends who are CEOs of other tech companies and tried to um getForward us uh started um I I would really heartened by the response which was that all thesefolks care about the bigger issue Right And I think in a lot of ways we all agree that actuallyaddressing and and helping out the 11 million undocumented folks is that actually a muchbigger problem than the high skill piece that the companies face So um that it it s a big problem Our companies would be better if we dealt with thatbut um 11 million people is a lot of people who are being treated unfairly now Applause  James B So you were up at the Hill today You met with Hill House Republicans I think to talk about this I wonder what your level of optimism is about actually getting something donein the short term Laughter   Well you know I m optimistic um I I but I m I m an entrepreneur right Youdon t um go off and try to build something crazy if um if you re not if you re not optimisticfundamentally about the world 00 08 00 So I mean what what I see isn t you know thestraight um bipartisan crash uh clash that people talk about all the time where it s like alright there s one side is trying to get something done and the other side that isn t On on this issue you know if you polled the majority of Americans they want to getsomething done Um and and even on very specific technical language the majority of folkswill support something Um folks on both in both parties um seem like they want to um byand large move things forward and there are It s a very complicated issue with a lot ofdifferent aspects so of course there s disagreements on specifics but I mean I ve onlyencountered who seem like they have good intentions and want to move this forward and um care about the people in their districts And what we are trying to do with Forward us is obviously were not writing the law right I mean that s uh all these folks know way more about about the sensitivities than we do We just want to be there to help support folks who are going to have to take challengingpositions in on on something that s going to be controversial but they ultimately believe is theright thing So that s why we re here and what we re going to try to do to help out  James B Forward us the organization you ve created to push this issue has taken somecriticism for the early advertising that it ran as sort of conventional political attack ads Um you you went in to sort of support the conservative credentials of a couple of candidates by goingafter Obama Care promoting oil drilling Are those the sorts of tactics are going to stick with Have you learned something from the experience so far   Yeah well there s been a lot to debug in in terms of in making this work Youknow the thing that s interesting is that before Forward us as far as I can tell there hasn t been asingle political organization or at least not one that s anywhere near this this big um that isfunding both Democrats and Republicans Right And um one of the things that s beeninteresting and and challenging is we ve tried to get senior folks on both parties um to cometogether and there s been interesting realities in that I was kind of shocked '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2014-025', 'content': ' Speaker 1 A warm welcome to all of you and also uhh our our Founder and CEO MarkZuckerberg Uhh we ve got about 20 to 30 minutes Uhh thank you for sending yourquestions well in advance In the interest of time umm I d like to hand the mike out toAnup Jairam from Business world  Anup Hi Mark you can inaudible 00 00 19 at Barcelona Inaudible 00 00 22 inBarcelona earlier this year I believe a meeting inaudible 00 00 28 today Are youusing more action with Indian telcos and are you What re you doing consideringthat India is uhh a market where you re going online through a mobile do you seetie ups with indian telecos happening  Speaker 1 So you met Sunil Mittal the chairman of Bharti at the Mobile World Congress inBarcelona Uhh Anup s question is considering that India s going online and mobileis a big boom uhh could we expect certain deals with uhh Airtel   I see so between Facebook and those companies Well I mean a lot of what we retrying to do and then what I talked about uhh in that In the short presentationis umm it Well all these different barriers right so there s the physical barriers theeconomic barriers and the social barriers and we re trying to work with folks to addressall of them I mean Facebook is not in a position by ourselves to bring connectivity toeveryone in the world so this has to be a partnership with with other companies andthe companies that are doing most of the work here are the operators right as As youwere saying so there are things that we can do like help develop new technologywhether it s satellites or or umm solar powered planes that can be new technology thatfolks like that can use Umm that s a little further off and we re just getting started developing that Umm in the near term the the bigger thing is this program for free basic servicesthat I talked briefly about where uhh we ll We ll go and work with 00 02 00 different operators in in different countries around the world and they ll offer umm some basic services that that they choose for free You know so some of it mightbe commercial services like Facebook or Google umm and some of it could be uhh nonprofit and social services like health or education or job boards or different thingslike that umm but we enable them to do that and and have built up a bunch ofinfrastructure to enable that and and As we work with operators we re learningmore about what works Umm it s really important that this model is profitable for the operators because the The infrastructure to support the Internet uhh I mean operators are spending tensof billions of dollars a year on this so this needs to be something that can serve peopleand help get more people on the Internet umm who might not be able to afford ittoday or might Just not know why they would want it umm spend some of theirmoney on on Internet access but it alsoneeds to be something that over time can can uhh be profitable for the operators so we re working on a uhh a series of partnerships like this I mean I don t have anyspecific uhh partnerships to announce today but you can expect that we re going to tryto work with all of the different operators in India and around the world  Speaker 1 Thank you Mark I ll like to call upon Eric Bellman from uhh The Wall StreetJournal  Eric Hi umm just was wanted to ask you talked about the different barriers Uhh couldyou give us very specific Indian examples of where Facebook has had sort of cultural andsocial barriers How you solved them and what are some of those barriers you haven tsolved yet Some of the   Yeah Well we re really early right so the The places where uhh where weworked with partners I listed some of them before but some of the initial testcountries were umm Indonesia the Philippines Tanzania Paraguay and then mostrecently last month in Zambia so we actually haven t launched any specificpartnerships around Internet org in India yet so in terms of making progress on this we re at the beginning  Male Facebook in India   Oh Facebook in India 00 04 00 Well so I mean one of the biggest ones that I talkedabout and that is a big focus of this Internet org summit is local language right I mean India is in an incredibly diverse country with You know that has a great diversity oflanguages more than almost any other country that that I can think of in the world and uhh And and on Facebook we ve really tried hard to support umm even 10 ofthe most popular languages but I mean there are hundreds of languages that folksspeak here and there are 22 official languages We have more work to do there umm and And then there is the the stats that I was talking about before where umm 80 of the content on the Internet umm is just in the top In the most popular 10 languages worldwide right so if you umm don t speak one ofthose languages then the Internet is going to be much less valuable to you than itshould be so there need to be things like umm what all these developers aregoing to focus on building to make it so that all these different services can get offeredin people s local languages in order to actually make the Internet relevant but that s abig a big issue Umm in terms of Facebook inIndia I mean there are more than a 100 million who use Facebook in India so we rereally happy that we re helping to connect that many people Uhh but in terms of uhh In terms of countries that have a large percent of their populationconnected India is really just at the beginning 243 million out of you know more than a billion people in the country uhh there aremore than a billion people that still need to be connected and that is not only a barrierfor for Facebook but I think for for everyone in in the country for reaching theirfull potential so that s what we re committed to doing here  Speaker 1 Thanks Mark Uhh I d like to call upon now Stuti Roy from the Press Trust of India Stuti Roy Hi Mark You talked about uhh you know the lack of awareness uhh as well so what isFacebook doing in terms of The content could be there but what is Facebook uhh going to do in terms of getting people onto Facebook or any On the Internet so thatthey You know they find Internet relevant   So 00 06 00 what we ve done in countries where we ve launched these free basicservices programs is we ll work with operators to make it so that the operator canchose which services they want to be free right and And for what period of timeand all that and and then umm we can You can raise awareness for that right so ifyou re If you re basically asking people umm do you want to buy a data plan thenthat s a big hurdle right A lot of folks don t have that much money and if they don tknow what they would get or why would they want a data plan then they might notwant to spend some of their disposable income on that but if the message is there arefree services that you can use on the Internet then that s something that Most people do have phones already right so it s more just a question of you you havea phone but you may not have a reliable or consistent access to the Internet and oncethese free basic service programs are rolled out with operators worldwide then it sa pretty easy message to get the word out of you know you can just access some ofthese things for free and we see people start using that immediately so umm I mean Idon t know if umm or the Zambia number is public yet I mean basically okay soI m not going to share them as as Chris is giving me that don t do that umm but umm but I mean it s it s Literally it s a program that we launched in the last monthand And and since then I mean a lot more A lot of people are using it right and and  Speaker 1 Isn t it uhh inaudible 00 07 18 model   Umm it s a model where we partner with the operators and often umm thegovernment is also involved in helping to build the social Some of the socialservices umm so I think in Zambia for example there are a handful of health servicesthat are offered umm where people can get free access to umm maternal health umm information uhh information on HIV and different and different umm localpublic health issues that they have and some of those I think are developed by thegovernment some are developed by nonprofits so it just ends up being this partnershipbetween a lot of different umm companies governments nonprofits and differententities to be able to bring this whole package of things to people for free Speaker 1 Thank you I d like 00 08 00 to uhh offer next question to Shilpa Kannan from BBCWorld  Shilpa Hi I just want to ask you you re meeting Prime Minister Narendra Moditomorrow so what is the main points of the discussion you re going to have with him What are you going to really ask him for   Well one of the things that I m really excited about is the Prime Minister has this wholedigital India initiative right so once again I mean it s It s really hard I mean we rejust this one company right so we can t create connectivity around the world byourselves We re primarily just trying to go and work with the folks who are alreadyforward leaning on that Umm so operators who re already trying to find a model tobuild up their network and serve more people Umm governments who re trying toget their whole population online and then a lot of it because it s so local is to figureout how we can plug in and what we can do to help support these different models so Iactually think umm You asked the question of what will I be asking for Umm I m mostly interested in learning and hearing what we can do to help Umm Imean there are certain things that I think Facebook can uniquely bring to bear so And Facebook is the the biggest Internet service worldwide in terms of people usingit umm so there are there are definitely things that umm that that we can do and alot of people of want to use Facebook so there There are things that we can probably help out with uniquely but I m also goingto be listening to try to figure out what we can do to help out  Speaker 1 Thank you Uhh next question to Aditya Kalra from Reuters  Aditya Hi uhh I wanted to ask a question about WhatsApp Umm after the deal how do youplan to integrate on a global scale with Facebook s advertising model and locally how doyou see Do you see any local competition as far as WhatsApp is concerned How doyou plan to monetize WhatsApp   Yeah So over the long term I think that there are pretty clear models for buildingbusinesses around messaging products so you can look at for example some of theChinese messaging products umm 00 10 00 Tencent s WeChat has been uhh widely successful as a business so I think that there are There are models that you canlook at Umm we have different ideas for things that we think that we can dodifferently from that but for the near future uhh by that I mean probably the nextfew years we re really most focused on just trying to help connect people and helpmore people use the service so right now umm more than 600 million people umm use WhatsApp monthly Umm there are lots of people around the world who aresending text messages SMS Umm I think that the market for WhatsApp should be in the billions right definitely more than a billion people umm we should be able to connect usingWhatsApp in the next few years and then hopefully more after that so that s ourprimary goal We try to take a pretty long term perspective on this and you know wealready have one good core business at Facebook so rather than just trying to focus onhow we re going to make money on WhatsApp in the near term the bigger thing thatI m focussed on is how do we make the biggest opportunity and connect the mostpeople  Aditya There is no near term time inaudible 00 11 00   No I mean not other than what they do today which is I mean they charge a dollar ayear for people to use their service Umm a longer term I think it ll be a much biggerbusiness than that and we ve ideas that we re thinking about for that but I I just Idon t that s not going to be a big focus for quite a while  Speaker 1 Thank you Next question back to Thomas from The Hindu Business Line  Thomas Hi Mark Uhh you spoke about a collaborative world where you want to sit withtelecom operators and handset makers uhh to push the Internet org agenda uhh butover the last uhh ever since you launched this program uhh you ve got one exampleof Airtel in in Africa uhh what s coming in the way or what re the challenges thatyou re facing uhh when you talk to telecos uhh for this kind of collaborativeapproach uhh given that traditionally telecos see peoplelike Facebook as the ODT players or you know there s been a lot of friction So uhh are these 00 12 00 issues coming in the way of the conversation or are there otherchallenges getting more people on board   So there are certain countries and and certain operators like in any industry that aregoing to be more forward leaning and wanting to try things umm than than others sowhat we ve tried to do is start in smaller countries umm where the it s easier to justtest things out and and an operator who wants to roll something out across the wholecountry or region can do so without having a huge amount of infrastructure like youwould need to do in India and what we re trying to do is build success cases and showthat you know for the folks who have done this in the Philippines and in Tanzania andParaguay and umm in Indonesia that those are successful umm for not only gettingmore people on the Internet which we have shown but also profitable for theoperators Then once we have those cases which we re building over time then we can go to tooperators in bigger markets like India that are Are more important and larger andjust kind of harder to to to to evolve for Because it s just so many people are arehere compared to some of these other countries and and then kind of make the case thatthis is going to be uhh a big thing Umm but you know India is such an importantcountry and there are so many people here that we didn t want to do this first and risknot doing it well here umm so that s a lot of why why we re kind of rolling it out theway that we are There is kind of There are normal dynamics that you would see inany any market where umm a lot of time the leading operator is not going to be riskloving and try to jump to do some new model A lot of the times its a uhh a challenger who wants to try a new thing first umm butthat s a very healthy thing and all we need to do is is basically find some folks that that want to try this out and ensure that it works both for connecting more peopleand building a more profitable model and then we think over time as uhh as itbecomes increasingly clear that this is good for everyone then we think that morepeople will adopt it but it s early I mean this is going to take years uhh to get doneand we ve only been working on this for maybe a year and a half now 00 14 00  Speaker 1 Thank you Uhh I d like to go across to Leslie from The Mint  Leslie Uhh uhh my question is around uhh privacy so Facebook has been doing a lot aboutprivacy but your entire business model is about collecting informationand you have got into trouble and there are always those privacy advocates who say that okay you have not done a fair job Uhh you have business compulsions youhave the user information but the point that one sees is that you do not have a uniformpolicy across governments across countries so for instance when the European Uniongets strong and demands action that s the time when you So you It s more like areactive thing but in a country like India for a developing country like India whichdoes not even have a privacy act what are the kind of policies that you think about Isthere going to be a uniform Facebook policy   Well the biggest thing that we do is is focus on building this product with all thesedifferent tools in it so that people can control exactly who sees each piece of of contentthat they re sharing right and that s one One of the most powerful things aboutFacebook is that it s not just a tool for sharing with one audience that you know if youwant to share something publically you can do that so for example umm once we getthe video of the talk that that I just gave I ll probably post that publically to all thepeople who follow me on Facebook but you know I also just post some other thingsto just my friends or I ll send a message to my wife and just kind of all these differentaudiences so a lot of what we re doing consistently has been that people can use thesedifferent tools umm and that it s clear what s going on right It s always One metric that we care really uhh care a lot about inside the companyis when people share something we we always We will often follow up afterwardsand ask people umm like a month later or so umm did you share with the audiencethat you wanted to and we re kind of always making these changes to make it so thatmore That everything is increasingly clear within the services because if ifsomeone is doing something that that isn t what they 00 16 00 want then thatdoesn t help them and it doesn t help us and it s just not good for anyone so thebiggest thing that we do is really in the product and less It s less about policy andwhenever we make a product improvement we roll it out across the whole world So you know maybe we re getting more feedback from you know people in the USor people in Europe on somethings or people in India on other things but we listen toall this feedback and we make changes in our products and then we roll it out all youknow 1 3 billion people who use Facebook and it should improve the experience foreveryone or at least that s the that s the goal but I mean we re certainly open to tofeedback and realize that a lot of these experiences are cultural and and local so wetry to We try our best to umm basically have empathy for all these different cultures and we ve three different officesin India and a big presence here and we re growing quickly and umm it s just reallyimportant especially for a country that s is is big and important as this that weunderstand the nuances culturally to make sure that we re serving that as well  Speaker 1 Thank you Uhh I d like to go across to Pankaj Mishra from The Economic Times  Pankaj Hi so do you still see scope for a new platform to come by and disrupt aFacebook or Google the you know what do you think of Allo and uhh youknow if you were to start again uhh do a start up again maybe in a place like India what would it would be like   Yeah I mean I think that there s so many different ways that people want tocommunicate Umm one way that that I kind of think about this is there are all thesedifferent kinds of Content is is one Access rights so there s people communicatingwith text and photos and videos and they share location and they share events andthere s all these different kinds of media and then there are different audiences right so some things umm you will just share with one person Like I ll I ll send a messageto my wife or I have a small group for my family or I have all my friends that I mcommunicating with or I have an interests based group or or public and each one ofthose things is an opportunity right so umm people sometimes you want to sharea photo with one person 00 18 00 Sometimes you want to share a photo witheveryone Sometimes you want to share a video with a small group Sometimes you want to sharea video with all your friends Sometimes you want to you know event You know you can just kind of go through this whole different matrix and combination ofthings so I guess the way that I think about this is there are certain things thatFacebook does really well already but Facebook I think is extremely good for helpingyou share almost any kind of content that you would want with a lot of friends atonce Umm we also I think probably have the biggest groups product in the world We have more than half a billion people umm use Facebook for for sharing with smallgroups even though that s kind of little lessor known and it s not as prominent in theproduct as newsfeed is Umm but there are other types of sharing that are growing incredibly quickly Publicsharing umm so the ability to kind of take a piece of uhh content maybe a photoand blast it out to everyone in the world There are certainly a lot of different productsfor that and that s a big area that s growing News isgrowing very quickly Umm messaging is an area that s growing incredibly quickly Umm I think part of the reason for that is some of these dynamics that that you reasking about where umm historically operators have charged a lot for SMS and I thinkthat that made it so that umm you know right now people are only sharing I think it slike 23 or 24 billion SMSes a day but if you actually If you took away some of thecost barriers for that I think we would probably be closer to 100 billion SMSes a daythat people would want to send So there are all these opportunities for ways that people want to share and rather thanthinking about it in terms of There s always going to be competition so if wedo job on the ones that we re working on umm then people will come out tocompete with us on that but I actually think most of the opportunity and futurecompetition is in new ways sharing that are not well served yet in the market todayand there are many of them and I think each of them are going to be products that a halfa billion or a billion people can use and that you know in Facebook we re trying to bethe best company for building all these different ways Building products for all thesedifferent ways that people want to share and that s just what we re really passionateabout  Pankaj If you want to build up a start up again   Umm 00 20 00 so I mean right now obviously you know you d focus onmobile right I mean when when I got started it was mostly computers and andmobile wasn t as big of a thing umm you know Uhh I myself I use a phone way morethan a computer these days I mean I write all my E mails on phones and all my I evenwrite long things like when when we had our IPO I wrote my VS1 letters this longthing I wrote on my phone Umm but so I mean definitely phone today Umm and Ialso think that so friends sharing I think people have a good tool with Facebook to sharewith all their friends Umm WhatsApp there s this huge opportunity betweenWhatsApp and Facebook Messenger for for private sharing and communication I think WhatsApp does extremely good for that so I m not sure if that s even Ifthat s a big kind of opening in the market at this point but there are always going to benew forms of content I think video is a huge thing that s going to grow over the nextfew years and I would just look for those openings right so where are there types ofmedia and kind of sets of people that people don t have tools to share with andsomeone will build something for those whether it s use or someone else  Speaker 1 Thank you I d like to go across to Bianca from Bloomberg  Bianca Thanks Uhh you ve said that you you re willing to spend billions on you know either drones satellites or lasers to to beam Internet in remote places I wonderwhat you say to the critics who say that maybe people in India need other thingsmore than Internet like toilets or clean water or access to to nutritious foodinstead of Internet and Facebook   Yes so I definitely don t believe that there s any one thing that people need I mean people definitely need food and water and health and toilets and like all all thesethings I mean these are like very fundamental and I mean if you re in a toilet youdidn t have water you d probably be in pretty bad shape right and and the other waytoo Umm you know Internet by itself it s not The Internet and technology aren tprogress right and I was I was 00 22 00 pretty careful to try to say this before Instead what the Internet brings is it s an enabler of a lot of these things so in Zambia for example in some of the cases that I was talking about umm people use theInternet in order to get the health information that they need to figure out how totake care of their kid when they re pregnant how to Like different things aroundmaternal health or HIV is a really big issue in Zambia specifically So I mean I I think it s a little tough to just say like people need one thingversus another but the reason why we are focussed on this is that the Internet issomething that we re really uniquely suited to help spread and we re aninformation technology company and we re an Internet company and weunderstand these dynamics well and when you go to a lot of these countries umm ifyou go to a a lot of developing countries and you ask people what data service theywant to use the most umm after they ve access to you know phones uhh phonecalling and SMS that you get with voice right so that you know and data data plan todo that umm the first thing that a lot of people want is Facebook right becausecommunication is it s so core right I mean so the primary tool is kind of phone calling and SMS or maybe the first two and those are communication and then once you have those then for a lot of people thenext thing that they want is the tool to be able to communicate with everyone else atonce umm which is is really what Facebook is and newsfeed is Umm sobecause of that we re kind of in this unique spot to be able to work with operators tohelp define a model like what we re trying to do with free basic services umm andthen this whole Internet org model We also have a lot of experience buildinginfrastructure Umm we have built up data centers around the world and umm and built up a networkwith a lot of fiber to build umm like really fast connections for folks and a lot of thatstuff ends up being the same type of things that you need to umm to build at least partof the network if you re If you have kind of aerial connectivity if you re buildingsolar powered plants and I mean there s certainly things we ve had to learn how to dothat we didn t know before but a lot of that once you can start beaming down theInternet you need to then go do the rest of the connectivity 00 24 00 Umm a lot of what we ve done so far contributes to being able to do some of thesethings so I kind of think what you want to prioritize doing in the world are the thingsthat you think are the most important and what you can uniquely serve people indoing and this is the sweet spot for us but you know I m never going to say thatInternet is more important than food or clean water I really think people need both tobe in a modern society but I I really think that we re much better suited to help out inproviding the Internet to people than clean water That s just not the company thatwe are  Speaker 1 Thank you Uhh the next question comes from Rama Lakshmi from TheWashington Post  Rama Hi Uhh you kept saying that India is an important country Apart from the sheernumbers what makes India more important than than any other country in the world uhh in other parts of the world And now that you re uhh talking about launchingfree basic services in India that what would you say to the concerns voiced by Netneutrality advocates that this walled garden approach has problems of creatingmonopolies   Sorry I didn t I didn t get the  Rama Creating monopolies This this kind of free rating walled garden approach   Oh I see Yeah Umm sorry and the first question I m like jet lagged and  Rama Apart from the sheer numbers   Right okay so yeah why Sorry sorry Okay so umm you know I mean I think thatthere are there are a couple of things I mean the sheer numbers are obviously areally important part of it and you get different dynamics with just the umm howyou build infrastructure for a country that s so huge umm and and some of the market dynamics around around moving that are There are differentchallenges and the ability to improve people s lives across the world the stakes are justso much higher so if you can do it in a country like India you re improving hundredsof millions or maybe a a billion peoples lives whereas doing it in almost any othercountry you just wouldn t be able to have that impact So we want to make sure that when we come and try to do that that 00 26 00 we recareful and have shown that we have a model that we know is going to be successfulbefore talking to folks about doing that The other thing is just culturally Imean this is the country that is very forward leaning on science and engineering umm and research and education and all these things that make it So that I think thatthe benefits of connectivity here are going to be very profound and umm and youknow different countries are going to use this for different things I mean there was a question a second ago about you know about basic health and andthe importance of that and there are going to be a lot of countries where you knowwhat the Internet brings is information about kind of some basic things about howyou can live safely but here I think what s going to happen is because you have some ofthe best engineers in the world and such a uhh a vibrant kind of research and andtechnology industry umm I think that broader connectivity is going to see peoplewith the ability to And I just think about like you know when I was startingFacebook I was just in a dorm room doing that I mean who are the all people whoprobably live here and in countries that have cultures like this who could be buildingservices uhh that you know the world is robbed of those services because thosepeople don t have the tools that they need to go build those things So you know I think when you bring Internet to a country like India you re not justhelping the people who don t have access to the Internet today you really areimproving the world for everyone else too because the the person who doesn t havethe tools that they need to go build that company and bring that idea to the world that sgoing to help people in all these other countries now have those tools or has thosetools and that s just a really profound thing That if we can play some role in makingthat happen that s a huge deal so to your second question umm I think you wereasking about umm yeah so  Rama Create monopolies   Yeah so the way that this works is we re trying to kind of pioneer this model wherean operator can offer free basic services umm as a way to 00 28 00 help peopleunderstand why the Internet is valuable for them umm offer some basic things for freethat are going to be valuable to the society ultimately with the goal of helpingpeople also learn more about what they can do on the Internet and ultimately buydata plans as well to to fund the development of the Internet Umm ultimately it s up to the operators to chose which services they want to include right so I think it s going to vary quite a bit country to country in terms of whichcompanies people want to include umm which nonprofit services and you know whichsocial issues are important that the government wants to fund umm app developmentfor it and include in these packages and you know there is no rule that says that Facebookor any other company has to be Has to be included in this I think a lot of what we aredoing is just proving that this is a model that works to get more people on the Internet umm and and to make it so that operators can also increase their profitability so thatthey can invest more in building out the infrastructure to grow the Internet to servemore people And you know I m optimistic that getting more people on the Internet will helpFacebook over the long term too but there s definitely no rule here that says that this is That Facebook has to be included in each country as the service If you take a countrylike China for example where Facebook is blocked I can guarantee you that even ifthe model is ends up being successful then like we re we re obviously not going to beoffered there umm and and you know that s fine because if more people get on theInternet there and have different services there then that s still really good for theworld  Speaker 1 Thank you We ve got time for one last question and I d like to give that uhh to VikasSingh from The Times of India Mike please  Vikas Hi Mark Uhh you know the Indian uhh legal system there s something calledSection 66 of the IT Act and uhh people can and do get arrested simply for clickinglike on a post that you know anybody can term to be blatant or uhh you knowinciting religious tension so when you mention the barriers maybe this is a fourthbarrier that exists the legal barrier and it may not just happen in India so do youthink that s something you need to look at   Yeah I would definitely I would group that in with the social barriers right  00 30 00 so I I think that you can look at the barriers as you know there sfundamental infrastructures There are people who they just live in a remote place umm where it just hasn t been cost effective for any operator to even build theconnectivity out to there so there s no even option to get on the Internet Then then the next set of barriers once you get past get past infrastructure iseconomics so there are 85 of people live within range of a network but a lot of themcan t afford it and then there are a lot of people that actually can afford it but don t useit for a number of reasons cultural umm language umm they don t understand whatthe value is and again this is like a good example of another one of those type ofissues  Vikas You know given your voice do you think we should more actively inaudible00 30 40 against this type of scenario   Umm I don t know I think it s We re going to push on the things that seem like thebiggest levers to make a different and where we can help out the most so right now umm the things we re we re That I think we can do on on each of those barriers soon some of the physical barriers you know we have in umm some experience inbuilding up these networks where we can do research around things like aerialconnectivity that a traditional operator might not be incentivized to go to do so that that would be helpful if we can roll that out The economics side we re trying to reduce the amount of data that our apps and otherapps that get that that people want to use umm consume so that with the cost ofusing apps get cheaper and people can afford to use more stuff and on the socialbarriers the primary thing that we re focused on is free basic services because byfar the number one thing that we hear is that umm a lot of people can afford to be onthe Internet but they don t know why it would valuable so And there s the studythat I quoted in there in there a minute ago which is that uhh a recent study said that69 of people who are not connected in India when you ask them why it s becausethey don t understand why the Internet would be valuable for them I think that that s a problem that we can help solve right by helping people get accessto to Facebook which a lot of people want 00 32 00 but also a lot of other basic toolsaround health education jobs communication different things that are justobviously valuable that people want umm and it will Itwill demonstrate the value of why you would want data to be on the Internet veryquickly Umm the legal system that s a very local thing right and you know we we have a presence here We have three offices We are growing quickly We re constantly hiring people but you know we re not We re not an Indiancompany fundamentally right and you know so we can We can help and be partof the debate but I would be a little careful about umm a company like ourstrying too hard to change the laws in any country and we re here to serve people umm and and the laws that they have chosen to have for themselves more than umm try to influence that  Speaker 1 Thank you uhh ladies and gentlemen Thank you Mark   All right

      "{'filename': '2015-048', 'content': '  Today we released our latest Global Government Requests Report and updated our Community Standards The first report lists the requests we ve received from governments around the world during the second half of 2014 The second provides greater clarity around the rules and limits of what you can share in our community Questions about free expression and how governments regulate it are some of the most difficult and important issues we face People rightfully want to know what content we will take down what controversial content we ll leave up and why I care deeply and feel a responsibility to handle this thoughtfully for our community This is a good opportunity for me to explain our philosophy Our mission is to give people the power to share and to make the world more open and connected We exist to give you a voice to share what matters to you from photos of your family to opinions about the world We believe the better you can share and connect the more progress society will make Relationships grow stronger more jobs and businesses are created and governments better reflect people s values As difficult questions arise about the limits of what people can share we have a single guiding principle We want to give the most voice to the most people Having a voice is not some absolute state It s not the case that you either have a voice or you don t It s not black and white When you have access to the internet you have more voice When you have better tools for sharing you have more voice When you have fewer laws limiting your speech you have more voice When you do not live in fear of social isolation or violence if you express yourself you have more voice Every day we work to give more voice to more people This means connecting everyone in the world through Internet org so the two thirds of people who are not yet connected have the ability to communicate like you can It means building services like Facebook and WhatsApp so you can easily share what matters to you It means protecting you from bullying and harassment so you feel safe expressing yourself And it means pushing back on illegal government requests to censor you and restrict your expression In an ideal world we would all feel empowered to express everything we want freely and safely In reality there are many obstacles in the way Every country including the United States has laws preventing you from sharing certain things to protect public safety and intellectual property But even if they didn t the perfect tools for expressing ourselves and reaching the people we want don t exist yet so we d still be limited Even if the perfect tools did exist most people couldn t access them anyway since the majority of the world s population doesn t have any internet access Even if we all had the perfect tools the internet and the legal rights to express anything people might still censor themselves for fear of harassment violence terrorism or just uncomfortable social situations We have a lot of work to do before every person in the world will have the voice they should have I ve written extensively in the past about our work to eliminate barriers to internet access for the next 4 billion people from offering free basic internet access partnering with operators to designing satellites and planes to deliver connectivity directly I ve also talked about all our apps and services that give you the power to share in different ways from private to public intimate groups to big communities plain text to rich photos videos and sound For the rest of this post I m going to focus on the social and legal barriers to expression We work to create a safe and respectful environment where you always feel comfortable being and expressing yourself That s why we have Community Standards to establish basic rules across our community including that threats of violence and bullying will be taken down These are examples where one person exercising their voice may unfairly limit the voices of many others Therefore in the spirit of giving the most voice to the most people we choose not to permit this content Today s update to our Community Standards provides more detail on these policies as well as explanations and examples of what isn t acceptable to share on Facebook Our policies themselves aren t changing We also need to recognize the different legal and cultural environments in which we operate Every country has laws limiting certain expression and these are often shaped by culture and history For example Holocaust denial is prohibited in Germany Content that defames Atat rk is illegal in Turkey In many Muslim countries content regarded as blasphemous is banned as well Governments sometimes order us to remove content they believe is illegal but that doesn t violate our Community Standards We provide information about these orders in our Global Government Requests Report We fight to protect our community from unnecessary or overreaching government intervention Facebook is a new kind of service so we often face regulations that have little precedent We push back to make sure we only comply with government demands when they re lawful and necessary If we have to block something prohibited in one country we generally try to leave it unblocked for the rest of the world so that limitations on sharing and voice are minimized We also work to expose how governments restrict what people share and that s why we publish the Global Government Requests Report Some people say we should ignore government orders requiring us to restrict people s voice even if that means the whole service would be blocked in those countries I don t think that s right I believe we have a responsibility to the millions of people in these countries who rely on Facebook to stay in touch with their friends and family every day If we ignored a lawful government order and then we were blocked all of these people s voices would be muted and whatever content the government believed was illegal would be blocked anyway This is a matter of giving the most voice to the most people Others argue that Facebook getting blocked might result in less voice for people in the short run but a country changing its laws over time Unfortunately there are few if any examples of a company withdrawing from a country leading to a change in laws restricting expression On the other hand there are many examples of how enabling people to connect and share helps make things better in a society Our philosophy of giving the most voice to the most people is driven by our mission to connect the world not our business Today we re blocked in several countries and our business is still doing fine If we got blocked in a few more it probably wouldn t hurt us much either The people it would hurt are the people in those countries Those are people who need a voice Our responsibility is to give them as much of a voice as we possibly can As we ve rolled out Internet org around the world we ve seen people do amazing things once they re connected People connecting with distant relatives for the first time in years Small business owners finding new customers online Expectant mothers preparing for pregnancy Even some connectivity makes life better It s tempting to think of free expression and having a voice as black and white either you have it or you don t But giving people a voice like most things in our society is something that we must make incremental progress towards Every internet connection counts Every service for sharing counts Every law counts Every tool protecting your safety counts Every day we build invent and fight to give the most voice to the most people One day our community will fulfill our mission of giving people everywhere the power to share and making the world more open and connected '}\n",

s a world where our generation can advance human potential and promote equality by curing disease personalizing learning harnessing clean energy connecting people building strong communities reducing poverty providing equal rights and spreading understanding across nations We are committed to doing our small part to help create this world for all children We will give 99 of our Facebook shares currently about 45 billion during our lives to join many others in improving this world for the next generation Thank you to everyone in this community for all your love and support during the pregnancy You ve given us hope that together we can build this world for Max and all children Letter A letter to our daughterDECEMBER 1 2015Dear Max Your mother and I don t yet have the words to describe the hope you give us for the future Your new life is full of promise and we hope you will be happy and healthy so you can explore it fully You ve already given us a reason to reflect on the world we hope you live in Like all parents we want you to grow up in a world better than ours today While headlines often focus on what s wrong in many ways the world is getting better Health is improving Poverty is shrinking Knowledge is growing People are connecting Technological progress in every field means your life should be dramatically better than ours today We will do our part to make this happen not only because we love you but also because we have a moral responsibility to all children in the next generation We believe all lives have equal value and that includes the many more people who will live in future generations than live today Our society has an obligation to invest now to improve the lives of all those coming into this world not just those already here But right now we don t always collectively direct our resources at the biggest opportunities and problems your generation will face Consider disease Today we spend about 50 times more as a society treating people who are sick than we invest in research so you won t get sick in the first place Medicine has only been a real science for less than 100 years and we ve already seen complete cures for some diseases and good progress for others As technology accelerates we have a real shot at preventing curing or managing all or most of the rest in the next 100 years Today most people die from five things heart disease cancer stroke neurodegenerative and infectious diseases and we can make faster progress on these and other problems Once we recognize that your generation and your children s generation may not have to suffer from disease we collectively have a responsibility to tilt our investments a bit more towards the future to make this reality Your mother and I want to do our part Curing disease will take time Over short periods of five or ten years it may not seem like we re making much of a difference But over the long term seeds planted now will grow and one day you or your children will see what we can only imagine a world without suffering from disease There are so many opportunities just like this If society focuses more of its energy on these great challenges we will leave your generation a much better world  Our hopes for your generation focus on two ideas advancing human potential and promoting equality Advancing human potential is about pushing the boundaries on how great a human life can be Can you learn and experience 100 times more than we do today Can our generation cure disease so you live much longer and healthier lives Can we connect the world so you have access to every idea person and opportunity Can we harness more clean energy so you can invent things we can t conceive of today while protecting the environment Can we cultivate entrepreneurship so you can build any business and solve any challenge to grow peace and prosperity Promoting equality is about making sure everyone has access to these opportunities regardless of the nation families or circumstances they are born into Our society must do this not only for justice or charity but for the greatness of human progress Today we are robbed of the potential so many have to offer The only way to achieve our full potential is to channel the talents ideas and contributions of every person in the world Can our generation eliminate poverty and hunger Can we provide everyone with basic healthcare Can we build inclusive and welcoming communities Can we nurture peaceful and understanding relationships between people of all nations Can we truly empower everyone women children underrepresented minorities immigrants and the unconnected If our generation makes the right investments the answer to each of these questions can be yes and hopefully within your lifetime  This mission advancing human potential and promoting equality will require a new approach for all working towards these goals We must make long term investments over 25 50 or even 100 years The greatest challenges require very long time horizons and cannot be solved by short term thinking We must engage directly with the people we serve We can t empower people if we don t understand the needs and desires of their communities We must build technology to make change Many institutions invest money in these challenges but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation We must participate in policy and advocacy to shape debates Many institutions are unwilling to do this but progress must be supported by movements to be sustainable We must back the strongest and most independent leaders in each field Partnering with experts is more effective for the mission than trying to lead efforts ourselves We must take risks today to learn lessons for tomorrow We re early in our learning and many things we try won t work but we ll listen and learn and keep improving  Our experience with personalized learning internet access and community education and health has shaped our philosophy Our generation grew up in classrooms where we all learned the same things at the same pace regardless of our interests or needs Your generation will set goals for what you want to become like an engineer health worker writer or community leader You ll have technology that understands how you learn best and where you need to focus You ll advance quickly in subjects that interest you most and get as much help as you need in your most challenging areas You ll explore topics that aren t even offered in schools today Your teachers will also have better tools and data to help you achieve your goals Even better students around the world will be able to use personalized learning tools over the internet even if they don t live near good schools Of course it will take more than technology to give everyone a fair start in life but personalized learning can be one scalable way to give all children a better education and more equal opportunity We re starting to build this technology now and the results are already promising Not only do students perform better on tests but they gain the skills and confidence to learn anything they want And this journey is just beginning The technology and teaching will rapidly improve every year you re in school Your mother and I have both taught students and we ve seen what it takes to make this work It will take working with the strongest leaders in education to help schools around the world adopt personalized learning It will take engaging with communities which is why we re starting in our San Francisco Bay Area community It will take building new technology and trying new ideas And it will take making mistakes and learning many lessons before achieving these goals But once we understand the world we can create for your generation we have a responsibility as a society to focus our investments on the future to make this reality Together we can do this And when we do personalized learning will not only help students in good schools it will help provide more equal opportunity to anyone with an internet connection  Many of the greatest opportunities for your generation will come from giving everyone access to the internet People often think of the internet as just for entertainment or communication But for the majority of people in the world the internet can be a lifeline It provides education if you don t live near a good school It provides health information on how to avoid diseases or raise healthy children if you don t live near a doctor It provides financial services if you don t live near a bank It provides access to jobs and opportunities if you don t live in a good economy The internet is so important that for every 10 people who gain internet access about one person is lifted out of poverty and about one new job is created Yet still more than half of the world s population more than 4 billion people don t have access to the internet If our generation connects them we can lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty We can also help hundreds of millions of children get an education and save millions of lives by helping people avoid disease This is another long term effort that can be advanced by technology and partnership It will take inventing new technology to make the internet more affordable and bring access to unconnected areas It will take partnering with governments non profits and companies It will take engaging with communities to understand what they need Good people will have different views on the best path forward and we will try many efforts before we succeed But together we can succeed and create a more equal world  Technology can t solve problems by itself Building a better world starts with building strong and healthy communities Children have the best opportunities when they can learn And they learn best when they re healthy Health starts early with loving family good nutrition and a safe stable environment Children who face traumatic experiences early in life often develop less healthy minds and bodies Studies show physical changes in brain development leading to lower cognitive ability Your mother is a doctor and educator and she has seen this firsthand If you have an unhealthy childhood it s difficult to reach your full potential If you have to wonder whether you ll have food or rent or worry about abuse or crime then it s difficult to reach your full potential If you fear you ll go to prison rather than college because of the color of your skin or that your family will be deported because of your legal status or that you may be a victim of violence because of your religion sexual orientation or gender identity then it s difficult to reach your full potential We need institutions that understand these issues are all connected That s the philosophy of the new type of school your mother is building By partnering with schools health centers parent groups and local governments and by ensuring all children are well fed and cared for starting young we can start to treat these inequities as connected Only then can we collectively start to give everyone an equal opportunity It will take many years to fully develop this model But it s another example of how advancing human potential and promoting equality are tightly linked If we want either we must first build inclusive and healthy communities  For your generation to live in a better world there is so much more our generation can do Today your mother and I are committing to spend our lives doing our small part to help solve these challenges I will continue to serve as Facebook s CEO for many many years to come but these issues are too important to wait until you or we are older to begin this work By starting at a young age we hope to see compounding benefits throughout our lives As you begin the next generation of the Chan Zuckerberg family we also begin the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to join people across the world to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation Our initial areas of focus will be personalized learning curing disease connecting people and building strong communities We will give 99 of our Facebook shares currently about 45 billion during our lives to advance this mission We know this is a small contribution compared to all the resources and talents of those already working on these issues But we want to do what we can working alongside many others We ll share more details in the coming months once we settle into our new family rhythm and return from our maternity and paternity leaves We understand you ll have many questions about why and how we re doing this As we become parents and enter this next chapter of our lives we want to share our deep appreciation for everyone who makes this possible We can do this work only because we have a strong global community behind us Building Facebook has created resources to improve the world for the next generation Every member of the Facebook community is playing a part in this work We can make progress towards these opportunities only by standing on the shoulders of experts our mentors partners and many incredible people whose contributions built these fields And we can only focus on serving this community and this mission because we are surrounded by loving family supportive friends and amazing colleagues We hope you will have such deep and inspiring relationships in your life too Max we love you and feel a great responsibility to leave the world a better place for you and all children We wish you a life filled with the same love hope and joy you give us We can t wait to see what you bring to this world Love Mom and Dad'}\n",

      "{'filename': '2016-006', 'content': ' Article Facebook founder and CEO  sat down with Axel Springer CEO Mathias D pfner for the German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag last week in Berlin Zuckerberg was given the first ever Axel Springer Award for being an exceptional innovator and entrepreneur This lightly edited Q A is an excerpt from an interview given to Die Welt Welt am Sonntag  D pfner Mark on Facebook we learned that you were jogging at the Brandenburg Gate this morning How was it   It was good It was the first time I have gone running in snow in 20 years Whenever I go to a new city in order to help get on the right time zone and actually get a chance to see that city I like running so today was awesome  D pfner It s not your first time in Berlin   No and I love it Berlin is one of my favorite cities in the world I feel like the energy is very youthful It has such an important history including its recent history of unification In a lot of ways Berlin is a symbol for me of Facebook s mission bringing people together connecting people and breaking down boundaries  D pfner How long did you run   4 miles today It was a short run  D pfner Do you think Berlin can play a role as a European hub for tech companies I mean it s now ranked 9th worldwide as a hub for startups   Absolutely Berlin definitely has one of the most vibrant of the startup scenes that I have seen Not really just across Europe but across the whole world in terms of cities It s an interesting dynamic  D pfner Is it taken seriously in Silicon Valley   Yes Of course the Silicon Valley is unique and Berlin is not yet comparable But of all the different cities that are building a startup infrastructure Berlin is the one with the most similar energy I wouldn t be surprised if in a short period of time you have that kind of ecosystem growing here too  D pfner So far Berlin is more about great ideas and not so much about big funding Do you think that money follows ideas   Yes but it is not just money If you think about companies that were built in Silicon Valley a lot of them early on were chip companies And now the companies that are there like Apple are much more successful than any of the chip companies were So arguably you couldn t have a company like Apple without first having that infrastructure of technology companies getting built up first They are missing in Berlin But the city is catching up  D pfner Did Facebook or did you personally invest in a Berlin company so far   I personally don t invest in a lot of companies because I think it would be a conflict of interest and Facebook doesn t typically either When we do corporate transactions we usually either just do business partnerships or buy companies entirely But there are certainly many companies from Berlin that we have worked with deeply So I mentioned Wooga before a major developer on our platform that built a bunch of games And Dubsmash was one of the first companies we cooperated with for the Messenger platform Soundcloud is another example  D pfner You visited Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator this morning   Yes So I visited this program Refugees on Rails at REDI School of Digital Integration which to me is the intersection of two things I care a lot about one is this mission of connecting people and breaking down boundaries and to me that s what this refugee crisis has been all about and it is something I just admire about Germany s leadership in the world When I look around the world and see so many countries turning people away I think it is terrible And I know that these are all issues that Germany is culturally dealing with in terms of integration but it is just something that I deeply admire So I wanted to get a chance to meet some of those folks personally and hear their stories of what they left behind in Syria and how they originally started learning how to program It was really touching And then of course I really care about technology education teaching people programming and those kinds of programs That was really impressive to see  D pfner Your current favorite topic is Virtual Reality Why are you so certain that VR is not a hype   There s a long term question and a short term question on this People often say that it is easier to predict the way things are going to be 10 to 20 years in the future than to predict how it is going to be 3 years from now There are going to be a few big trends AI will continue making progress we will be able to cure a lot more diseases in the future We all know that The real art is being able to see how we get from here to there We are betting that Virtual Reality is going to be an important technology I am pretty confident about this And now is the time to invest We just announced this week that there have already been one million hours of video consumed in Gear VR and we just started shipping that with Samsung So this is really encouraging I honestly don t know is how long it will take to build this ecosystem It could be 5 years it could be 10 years it could be 15 or 20 My guess is that it will be at least 10 It took 10 years to go from building the initial Smartphone to reaching the mass market BlackBerry came out in 2003 and it didn t get to about a billion units until 2013 So I can t imagine it would be much faster for VR  D pfner You invested 2 billion dollars with Facebook in Oculus Rift Are you really interested in the hardware the glasses Please explain the VR strategy of Facebook   We re mostly interested in the software But there is a time early on in the development of any new platform where you really need to do the hardware and the software at the same time Only later does specialization become valuable So you get a company that is really good at the hardware and one that is really good at software Everything is changing quickly enough that you kind of want the iteration to be linked Which is why we also take care of the hardware although our long term role will be in the field of software  D pfner And with Oculus Rift you are also developing the technology that you are now delivering to Samsung for the Gear rollout is that correct   Exactly And Gear will probably ship many more units than Rift  D pfner You are shipping the technology although both are competitors because you want to establish VR globally as quickly as possible or did I get it wrong   Exactly They are different price points and quality  D pfner 600 dollars versus 100 for Samsung yeah   Yes Although to be honest the Rift is even more expensive than 600 because it requires a very powerful PC to run So that PC unless you already have a powerful PC costs another 1000 dollars  D pfner  so you ask yourself why should anyone buy Oculus Rift   Because it provides a much much better experience  D pfner Why   Because VR is a very intense visual experience and having the most powerful PC is the only way to deliver certain experiences So for example we have experiences running in Rift where you are not only looking around but you have hands where you can manipulate objects in real time You are playing Ping Pong or interacting with someone and the technology needs to be fast enough so that when you do something it triggers and sends that action all the way across the Internet to someone else That just requires a lot more processing power to do well  D pfner How big is it going to be the VR business I saw Goldman Sachs predicting it is going to be an 80 billion dollar business   We are betting on two trends First that people will always want more immersive ways to express themselves So if you go back ten years ago on the internet most of what people shared and consumed was text Now a lot of it is photos I think going forward a lot of it is going to be videos getting richer and richer But that is not the end In the future I think you are going to want to capture a whole scene a room to be able to transport to that To be able to stream what you are doing live and have people be able to interact in that space  D pfner Could you imagine that one day the most frequent type of conversation will be the VR chat That people are going to chat with each other like that   Absolutely  D pfner Do you have any idea when that will be   I am not sure I think the challenge is that it would have to be meaningfully better than a video conference to be worth it But I think you could build a simple version of it pretty soon So the one trend is going towards increasing richness The other trend is the development of more and more immersive and powerful computing platforms We started off with servers that were the size of buildings and someone needed a degree to be able to run them Then you got the PC which was this big tower and people didn t really like using it but it could do a bunch of stuff Then we got phones which people love using and almost everyone has them But it is still kind of awkward to have to take it out of your pocket and the screen is not that big or immersive So I do think a new computing platform always emerges every 10 or 15 years VR is currently the most promising candidate  D pfner A couple of days ago there was a striking picture of you in Barcelona You were walking on a stage and no one recognized you because they were all wearing these VR glasses You were smiling and seemed to enjoy it Critics are now saying that this example shows that the virtual reality experience is isolating because it is no longer a collective experience How do you react to these concerns   Nothing could be further from the truth The exact opposite is the case What was going inside the headsets was a video of children playing soccer in some faraway place You could look around and you could see the kids playing soccer around you and it was a shared experience with everyone in that place that would have been impossible experience otherwise It would have kind of been like going to a movie but a much more personal thing where you are all actually in it I think people tend to be worried about every new technology that comes along Critics worry that if we spend time paying attention to that new kind of media or technology instead of talking to each other that that is somehow isolating But humans are fundamentally social So I think in reality if a technology doesn t actually help us socially understand each other better it isn t going to catch on and succeed You could probably go all the way back to the first books I bet people said why should you read when you could talk to other people The point of reading is that you get to deeply immerse yourself in a person s perspective Right Same thing with newspapers or phones or TVs Soon it will be VR I bet  D pfner A couple of weeks ago I met an Israeli entrepreneur a neuro scientist who said that he is developing a technology he says could create VR experiences without headsets in a couple of years as a kind of hologram in free space It sounded fascinating but also pretty science fiction   I think we will eventually get there I don t know how long or how far out that is The vision eventually is to have normal looking glasses that can either give you a fully immersive experience or that can just display information as you are walking around your day Yes there are people who are making progress on a number of questions but I still think there are some fundamental issues of optical science that need to get resolved Then once you have that then you need to figure out how to actually manufacture these experiences at scale If a product costs 10 000 or 20 000 it has limited use This is what the first computers cost Only when almost everyone is able to afford it will it be a real thing My guess is that s many years out  D pfner From a Facebook perspective what is the next big trend after Virtual Reality   I think about our work on three time horizons There s the products and parts of the business which are at scale now That s Facebook and News Feed Instagram to some degree WhatsApp Then for the next five years there are a handful of new challenges that we need to figure out and video is probably the biggest one I think video is a mega trend almost as big as mobile Then there is the 10 year horizon really far out stuff And for that we are investing in three big areas One is connectivity making sure that everyone in the world has access to the internet This is a big deal because today only 3 of 7 billion people have access to the internet If you live in an area where there is not a good school the internet may be the best way to get access to a lot of education material The same is true if there is not a good doctor the internet may be the best way to get access to health The second area is AI We expect a lot of progress that will lead to really great things in society reduction in car accidents from self driving cars better diagnoses for diseases Better ability to precisely treat diseases will lead to greater safety and health and many other things And the third area is this next computing platform which we believe is VR and augmented reality So these are things I think we are going to be working on for a decade or more  D pfner How will Artificial Intelligence change society   From my experience there are really two ways that people learn One is called supervised learning and the other is unsupervised You can think of supervised learning as they way you read a children s book to your son or daughter and point out everything Here s a bird here s a dog there s another dog By pointing things out a child can eventually understand oh that s a dog because you told me 15 times that that was a dog So that s supervised learning It s really pattern recognition And that s all we know how to do today The other the unsupervised learning is the way most people will learn in the future You have this model of how the world works in your head and you re refining it to predict what you think is going to happen in the future Using that to inform what your actions are and you kind of have some model Okay I am going to take some actions and I expect this to happen in the world based on my action AI will help us with this  D pfner Can you understand the concerns that business magnate Elon Musk has expressed in that context He seriously fears that artificial intelligence could one day dominate and take over the human brain that the machine would be stronger than men You think that is a valid fear or do you think it s hysterical   I think it is more hysterical  D pfner How can we make sure that computers and robots are serving people and not the other way around   I think that the default is that all the machines that we build serve humans so unless we really mess something up I think it should stay that way  D pfner But in chess Garry Kasparov was beaten by the computer Big Blue in the end So there may be more and more situations where a computer is simply smarter than a human brain   Yes but in that case people built that machine to do something better than a human can There are many machines throughout history that were built to do something better than a human can I think this is an area where people overestimate what is possible with AI Just because you can build a machine that is better than a person at something doesn t mean that it is going to have the ability to learn new domains or connect different types of information or context to do superhuman things This is critically important to appreciate  D pfner So this is science fiction fantasy and is not going to happen in real life and we don t need to worry about the safety of human intelligence   I think that along the way we will also figure out how to make it safe The dialogue today kind of reminds me of someone in the 1800s sitting around and saying one day we might have planes and they may crash Nonetheless people developed planes first and then took care of flight safety If people were focused on safety first no one would ever have built a plane This fearful thinking might be standing in the way of real progress Because if you recognize that self driving cars are going to prevent car accidents AI will be responsible for reducing one of the leading causes of death in the world Similarly AI systems will enable doctors to diagnose diseases and treat people better so blocking that progress is probably one of the worst things you can do for making the world better  D pfner This is exactly what Elon Musk is pushing with his company Tesla Nevertheless he is afraid of the uncontrolled development of Artificial Intelligence in the hands of very few people and megacorporations In this case it is an American who has the worries Usually this is the European position you see the risks and the downsides first and then you see the opportunities Is there a difference in mentality between Americans and Europeans in that context   I am not sure I would generalize that broadly There are people who are hopeful and people who are more skeptical all over the world  D pfner Your daughter Max is to have a robot nanny What do you expect from the robot   I am basically building this very basic AI system to control my home So I can tell it to turn off all of the lights or let this person in through the gate or it can see when I am coming in and expect me and it can open the gate Really basic stuff honestly But using some modern AI systems of voice recognition image recognition pattern recognition systems that modern AIs can do A lot of this for me it s a personal challenge so I love coding and building things  D pfner You still do code yourself   I do As a personal challenge for myself I don t do it for Facebook because we have this rule at Facebook that if you check in code than you have to support it Which means if there is a bug in your code than you have to drop everything you re doing and go fix it  D pfner Which of course you can t do   And I don t want to be in a situation where I have to leave some other commitment or worse I am rude and someone else has to support my stuff I stopped coding for Facebook a while ago  D pfner But you do it as a private hobby so to speak   Exactly I like staying in touch with the state of the technology and this is just a cool way of doing that  D pfner When and why did you get the idea to launch Facebook   You know it s this funny idea in society that there is a moment where you have an idea and then you kind of create something from that I don t actually think that that s the way a lot of things work in the world  D pfner So the myth that you did it because you wanted to date girls is not correct   No no no That s the film version  D pfner  Social Network   Hollywood has nothing to do with real life  D pfner I mean you were already dating Priscilla in 2003 Facebook was founded in 2004   Exactly When I was in college I remember thinking to myself this internet thing is awesome because you can look up anything you want you can read news you can download music you can watch movies you can find information on Google you can get reference material on Wikipedia except the thing that is most important to humans which is other people was not there There was no tool where you could go and learn about other people I didn t know how to build that so instead I started building little tools And when I was in college I stated off and built this tool because I wanted to know what classes I should take so I wanted to know what classes other people would take and were interested in I built out this little tool that listed what classes you were taking and it was called Coursematch The thing that was fascinating is within a week so many people were using it and it was just text And then I kept on building more and more things just like that I did build the Facematch thing that was in the movie but that was just a prank  D pfner But how did it become Facebook   For the final the class called the Rome of Augustus it was an art history class there were all theses pieces of art in the class and they were going to show you a handful and you would need to write an essay about the historical significance of that piece of art I hadn t paid much attention in the class because I was programming other things so when it came time for the final I was like oh I am screwed I don t know any of this stuff So as a study tool I built a little service that showed you at random one of the pieces of art and let you enter what you thought was significant from an art history perspective So I sent it out to the email list for the class and said hey I have a study tool and everyone just filled in what is significant about all the pieces of art and it ended up being this great social study tool I think the grades on the test that year were higher than they had been in the past So there were all these different projects I probably did like 10 different things like this when I was at Harvard I thought I should put some of this stuff together to create a tool where people can share whatever they want with the people around them And that was how the first version of Facebook came  D pfner How long did the development take   It only took me two weeks to build the first version of Facebook because I had so much stuff before then  D pfner And of course you probably hadn t the idea that this could transform into a three hundred billion dollar company   No not at all  D pfner When did you sense that it could be really a big thing   You know I actually remember very specifically the night that I launched Facebook at Harvard I used to go out to get pizza with a friend who I did all my computer science homework with And I remember talking to him and saying I am so happy we have this at Harvard because now our community can be connected but one day someone is going to build this for the world And I didn t even think it might be us It was not like oh I hope we can turn this into something big In my mind there was no way this is going to be us It was going to be someone else we are just college students When I look back on the last twelve years what has been the most surprising it s that no one else did it And I ask myself why no one else did it  D pfner Why   I just think it s because there were all these little reasons not to do it You know people at every step of the way said Oh that s just for young people so they didn t work on it as much as they could Or Fine a bunch of people are using it but it will never make any money Or Oh it works in the US but it is not going to work around the world Or Oh it works but it is not going to work on mobile All these different reasons you know how it is  D pfner And you just did it   Yes  D pfner What is Facebook going to look like in 10 years Do you have an idea   If we make a lot of progress on connectivity and AI and VR and AR then I think we live in a world where the majority of people are on the internet so our community will be much bigger I think people will have richer tools to share and experience life The ability to share whole scenes form our lives will be a valuable thing over time One example that Priscilla and I talk about is how do we want to capture when Max takes her first steps I want to capture the whole scene I want a 360 degree camera so if parents and my family aren t there they can feel like they were there I think this will be possible soon  D pfner Where s the limit for Facebook Do you see any limit   We are very focused on our mission of giving people the power to share in the ways that they want and connecting everyone in the world  D pfner What is the biggest risk for Facebook Is your worst enemy your own success in a way   I think it always is Companies face a handful of different risks whether it is competitors or different market environments But I think that people focus way too much on competitors and not enough on their own execution And I think if we just do a good job executing then that to me is by far the biggest variable in what we achieve  D pfner Is Facebook a distribution platform or a publisher   Definitely a distribution platform  D pfner Why don t you want to become a publisher Because we re a technology company I think the platform is the core of our product that people use to share and consume media but we ourselves are not a media company That s why this partnership strategy of working with others who know better how to create exciting contents is so crucial We want to remain a technology company  D pfner How do you perceive the hate speech debate in this context   While we generally believe in free speech and giving everyone as much ability to speak as possible in practice there are lots of barriers to that whether it s legal restrictions technological restrictions or you can t share what you want if you don t have access to the internet And there are social restrictions where someone could be suppressing someone else s freedom to express themselves So our North Star is that we want to give the most voice possible to the most people Of course hate speech and racism have no place on Facebook We have clear Community Standards and teams to enforce them In addition we work closely with governments and local organizations to be certain we are applying the Standards appropriately for local conditions and to identify and remove hateful or threatening content For example in light of the threatening speech directed towards migrants in Germany we now remove that content from our service  D pfner And also not to decide what more than a billion users read or not This would be editorial work the task of a publisher I think it would be a much greater threat if a global company with more than a billion users per day used subjective criteria to determine who may read and write what This is why the debate is misleading For a technological communications platform the sole restrictive framework should be the framework of the laws   You and I agree however not everyone shares our view  D pfner The international European headquarters of Facebook is in Ireland To avoid paying taxes in European markets   No There are a number of reasons why Dublin is a pretty good place One is that we are still primarily an English speaking company so having the headquarters in a place where the majority of people speak English is good We ve made significant investments in Ireland with over 1000 employees a new headquarters and now building a state of the art sustainable data centre  D pfner Last year Facebook paid 4327 GBP in taxes in Great Britain You do see how the tax debate is an issue right   I think that the tax situation needs to be worked out between the countries themselves In my experience everyone will have a different view of the right level of tax so governments need to provide clear guidance that conforms to a set of international standards that all governments accept Like any responsible company with international operations European or American we abide by those rules and comply with tax laws in the countries where we operate But I think it s also important to look at the contribution and investments we make in Europe Just this month in Germany we opened a new office we announced a partnership on Artificial Intelligence with TU Berlin and we invested in a German based community operations centre  D pfner Do you understand the European concerns about data protection data privacy Is it a cultural clash between the US and Europe   I think this is really tricky Some of it I think is a deep cultural thing where the history in Europe I think has made people very sensitive to a lot of these issues  D pfner Because of the Holocaust and how Nazis and also the GDR dealt with people s data   Absolutely  D pfner America doesn t have these historic traumas   Right And it s recent It s not hundreds of years old So that is something that I think culturally is just much more sensitive And we can acknowledge and try to understand that sensitivity but without being here I think it is difficult to fully internalize that viewpoint  D pfner It is only historical style or also in response to very current developments   Yes I think it is also about very contemporary conflicts between governments With some of the issues around the Snowden leaks and what the NSA was doing I think have scared people around the world and I think in many ways rightfully so I think that there are real questions there So it s a tough environment to navigate A company like Facebook is at the intersection of a lot of these questions and we just try to do the best to act responsibly  D pfner The Sons of the Caliphate Army from ISIS published a hate video against you and Jack Dorsey What does it feel to be a victim of these terrorists in a way so far only verbally   I am not sure I am very concerned but not because of the video There have been worse threats A number of years ago where someone in Pakistan was trying to get me sentenced to death because a member of our community created a group encouraging people to draw picture of the prophet Mohammed which is illegal in Pakistan But the Pakistani government wanted us to take down the content across the world which of course we weren t going to I think the bigger issue is that what Facebook stands for in the world is giving people a voice and spreading ideas and rationalism '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2016-015', 'content': ' Station Control Houston please call station for voice check   All right station this is  at Facebook can you hear me okay  Tim Kopra Hey Mark we read you loud and clear it s a pleasure to talk with you today   Uh it s great to talk to you guys too I have to say when you re building products to try to connect everyone in the world um connecting folks who are out in space um is about as extreme as cool as it gets So it s it s awesome to have the opportunity to 00 00 30 talk to you guys today Thanks for doing this So I think we should start by can you  Tim Kopra It s our pleasure   Can you um introduce yourselves and your roles and how long you ve been working up there for  Tim Kopra Yeah sure my name is Tim Kopra I m the Commander of the International Space Station for Expedition 47 Tim Peake and I arrived on the fifteenth of December and uh we ve been working up here for about 169 days 00 01 00 What a great place to uh to work and live And uh Tim Peake is is uh one of our Flight Engineers Jeff Williams is a flight engineer as well just arrived a couple of months ago and uh this is his fourth flight in space third time on the space station so a great person to have on board This is my second flight Tim s first flight here And uh we have three cosmonauts on board too that are at at the end of station that make our compliment of a six person crew   Nice 00 01 30 So let s start with a couple of questions here about the science that you re doing on board the space station So what kind of research are you doing in space that we can t do anywhere else  Tim Kopra That s a great question Mark You know uh one of the main things that we do is try to understand uh the impacts of zero gravity on the human body a lot of negative impacts And so in large measure we re an experiment So    Laugh  Tim Kopra We exercise a couple hours every day 00 02 00 which is a mitigation for the loss of uh bone density and muscle mass We have our eyes scanned because there s issues with your eyes as a consequence of zero gravity   Hmm  Tim Kopra And uh several other things that we do on board to try to make sure that when we go beyond low earth orbit we fully understand the implications of zero gravity on the human body But well beyond that we do lots of basic research up here as well because when you remove the zero the uh gravity component to a lot of physical phenomena you learn a lot of things 00 02 30 So we have physical science experiments that range from combustion to uh to fluid flow to microbiology and so we re learning a ton and uh we expect that to pay dividends long term in terms of benefit for our planet   All right so I m I m curious to hear about what kind of technology you guys are working on that s gonna help us travel to Mars Um beyond of course all the communication technology that we re working on to be able to connect with you guys uh to to make sure that that works  Jeff Williams  00 03 00 Well I think in general the ISS program is a big achievement in terms of the path to future exploration I mean just building and running and maintaining uh logistically uh learning how to operate it day to day and for the long term for years to come all that s going to support future exploration no matter where we go Of course uh uh a an example that s been in the news here recently especially in the last couple of weeks is the uh the BEAM 00 03 30 Module   Mm hmm affirmative  Jeff Williams Uh the inflatable module which we re we ve got inflated now and we re going to outfit it instrument it Um it s a new technology which will of course allow uh greater volumes to uh to be launched um with fewer launches Uh and of course it s gonna take a lot of volume to send a crew uh away from earth uh no matter where the destination is   All right so let s take some questions from the thread And by the way it s awesome to see the microphone just flying around over there 00 04 00 um that is not something that I m used to even in our virtual reality lab where we can make stuff like that we just haven t yet Um so let s go to the thread So we ve got a question from Hakeem which is obviously astronauts train extensively for this kind of a mission but is there anything in particular that you weren t expecting or that surprised you Like the microphone Laughing  Tim Peake Yeah that s a a good question and for myself as 00 04 30 a a you know a rookie astronaut on my first flight there were so many new experiences You know the training is phenomenal Um we have a wonderful training team all around the world in all of our international partner sites um but it s the real experience of you know launching in a Soyuz rocket and seeing that first orbit of planet earth going through sunset seeing a moon rise seeing a sun rise um uh it s just you can t put into words how beautiful the planet is from up here and also having the the privilege of seeing it change 00 05 00 over the the nearly six months that we ve been up here now already and seeing the northern hemisphere going from winter to summer seeing thunderstorms at nighttime the aurora Um I mean it s just absolutely incredible so uh I think it s all of those kind of elements that the training really just can t prepare you for   You know I have to say I think it s amazing how precise everything that you guys do has to be So just getting ready for this Live today which by the way is the first Live that we ve ever done to outer space so that that is awesome Um you know normally at Facebook 00 05 30 sometimes we run a few minutes early or a few minutes late and I know our team asked um ground control mission control um you know if it was cool if we started a little late and they responded Like yeah sometimes we start as much as 10 seconds late in our events And um and I I just thought that that was the funniest thing Um but it it s amazing how precise you guys uh need need to be in everything that you do to make things run run safely Um so all right so let s um so what what s the next question that we should we should 00 06 00 go to We we um on the thread um Martha has has written in uh My second grade students uh in Florida she s a teacher Want to know uh how do you talk to each other if you re all from different countries and speak different languages  Tim Kopra We know uh we do speak different languages up here uh Tim speaks British laughing Uh we speak American no but seriously we have uh three Russian cosmonauts on board and uh 00 06 30 we ve had a whole host of different international astronauts up here uh Japanese Canadians Germans all kinds of European astronauts um and as a consequence you know we have to be able to communicate Uh but typically when we do our training if it s uh a German or a Japanese or a Canadian or American training we speak English When we go to Russia we speak in Russian And so we all speak   Hmm  Tim Kopra Russian to varying degrees of   Hmm  Tim Kopra Uh of skill level Our uh 00 07 00 Russian cosmonaut friends speak English very well and uh so when we get together typically on board you know we ll speak either Russian or English or maybe a Ruslish a combination of both But uh it s very important for us to communicate and and in fact that s probably the biggest uh aspect of our job up here is to make sure that everybody is on board and synchronized just like you said it s important to be on time and to have things done well but that s all done through effective communication and that s really done by us knowing uh each 00 07 30 others languages at least Russian and English well enough that we can train in both those different environments   Very impressive So in addition to being top scientists and in great shape and very precise operationally you also need to be linguists So so let s go to another question on on the thread which is a little more fun Is Do food and drinks taste differently in space  Tim Kopra You want to grab those foods  Jeff Williams Um most 00 08 00 astronauts that have been up here over the years will say that their tastes change    Laugh  Jeff Williams A little bit um I think it has to do mostly with uh we kind of get a fullness in the head uh due to the environment that we g uh have a fluid shift of our body because uh the gravity s not pulling um um   Hmm  Jeff Williams Uh down um so that sometimes results in a stuffiness or whatnot So maybe our tastes um are are attenuated a little bit uh so most of us like to have spicier food 00 08 30 up here um uh the food can taste a little bland so we ll we ll spice it up a little bit on our own Um so I would say food does taste a little bit different We by the way have a wide variety of food on board uh from all different countries um uh from the partner countries uh represented in all the partners so the food up here is very very good   And is astronaut ice cream a real thing 00 09 00 Laugh  Tim Kopra We know that uh astronaut ice cream that you buy in the gift store that powdery stuff yeah that s not real but uh    Laugh  Tim Kopra We ve had ice cream on board When SpaceX came up they delivered a bunch of ice cream in a freezer so that s been quite quite the treat I think we re down to our last few bars we re trying to ration it So that s the   Hmm  Tim Kopra Real ice cream and that s uh quite a treat up here   Awesome All right so I want to make sure that we get back to our our Live community um because this is their you know the first chance that that we ve had to stream live 00 09 30 to to space Um so Rob has a question uh which is What advice can you give aspiring explorers like me uh regarding how you got to be where you are today on board the International Space Station  Tim Peake You know that s a question we get asked quite a lot and if you look at the astronaut core not just in one country but all over the world we all come from so many different backgrounds Um some people have come from scientific from 00 10 00 engineering from a aviation medical doctors maybe teachers Uh the one thing that we share in common is that we re very passionate about what we do Um and and we ve worked as hard as we can to get where we are So to any young people who are aspiring to become an astronaut or become explorers or just to go into the space industry I would say just um you know focus on what it is that you re good at um and what you enjoy because if you enjoy something that s what you tend to be best at Um work hard at it be passionate about it and uh you know you ll get where 00 10 30 you ll get where you want to go   Yeah I agree I think it s a lot of the same stuff for becoming an entrepreneur as well Uh so you know question that I have is I I ve heard that you guys use social networking and social technology quite a bit to communicate with people uh back down on earth and I m curious to to hear how that goes Um you know how how the internet connection works and uh basically do you have any feedback for me on on how we can make the service better for you Laugh  Tim Kopra  00 11 00 You know social media is uh is a really nice way to reach your friends and family from up here and uh you know our internet connection is actually a relatively new thing and so um we re very happy to have that because you know I the whole world has become so connected that it s it really feels uh feels good that we can s sort of be connected It s not quite the same speed bandwidth it that uh folks have down on the ground but it s it s uh good enough 00 11 30 and it allows us to keep in touch with uh with friends and family But uh you know social media for us for me personally I can say is is great because it s one way that I can share the photographs that I take and and a few thoughts that I have up here because one thing about life up here it s so unique and uh it is such an opportunity and a a blessing for us to be up here that um to be able to share it with other people especially a wide audience I mean a huge audience frankly with social media is uh is just a a tremendous 00 12 00 benefit So um you know for myself I just I enjoy being able to share pictures and you know a few thoughts from our experience up here   Yeah well I I love following the photos as well myself So what do you guys do for fun when you re when you re out and um in in a zero gravity environment I mean w what s the most fun thing that you ve found to do that that uh you you didn t expect  Jeff Williams Well we do 00 12 30 a lot of things that are fun Uh actually we none of us get tired of viewing the earth from up here so we    Laugh  Jeff Williams Spend a lot of time in the windows studying uh   There you go  Jeff Williams All the details of the earth uh Tim uh talked about the different seasons and stuff go that goes by and um you know the different lighting conditions and the weather patterns and uh you know all the uh the geography and the geology um and the ocean currents and and thunderstorms seeing lightening ripple acrossed a a weather system Uh that s a lot of fun so we spend a lot of time in the window 00 13 00 Of course uh you ve you ve talked about the microphone we all um    Laugh  Jeff Williams Um can from time to time especially around the dinner table play with our food in uh unique ways uh so we all get to be kids again uh and those kinds of uh uh doing those kinds of things It s fun to play with water and weightlessness and uh uh you know take a bubble of water and do different things with it So just uh the weightless environment and the view I think are the two main uh areas that we have fun with    00 13 30 So just fly around and and flip around the space station laugh There you go That s what I was looking for All right So Uh going back to a a a science question for a bit um thank you guys for doing that by the way I think it would not have been a complete first Live to uh to space without uh some astronauts uh flipping around in in zero gravity 00 14 00 Um so going back to science for a second and you you were talking about how a lot of this is experimenting on the human body to see what um what it can take in space What s the longest period that any astronaut has remained in space Um and and what are the experiments that are being conducted um geared towards future longer space travel and exploration  Tim Kopra Well you know I don t have the the data 00 14 30 on the records I know that uh you know Scott Kelly and Misha Kornienko just got back after you know very close to a year There are cosmonauts that spend even more time in space Uh cumulatively I think uh you know the records will continue to be broken you know cumulatively like Jeff this being his uh third long duration space flight   Hmm  Tim Kopra So you know number of days overall um is extremely high That s I mean it s really impressive that uh that the human body   Yeah  Tim Kopra Can endure 00 15 00 such long periods in space especially repeatedly But a lot of the experience the experiments we re doing up here really directly relate to those long duration missions that will take us beyond low earth orbit because we have to make sure that we maintain our our bone density and muscle mass that our eyes are in good shape and those are three areas that uh we re very very proactive in And we have to be right Because we re up here for half a year at a time we just had an astronaut and a cosmonaut here for close to a year 00 15 30 and so those are the kinds of experiments that uh that are really gonna lend themselves to us understanding what it takes to to go much farther And so it s gonna be a a step by step process and you know science is not necessarily a a linear process where you you learn things uh i in a very linear fashion It s gonna be uh breakthroughs it s gonna be a lot of uh uh time spent trying to understand these phenomena and you know eventually we ll get there I think we ve made so many strides as a consequence of the International Space Station 00 16 00 and I think we ll continue to   All right um I think we probably have time for one more question and you know Facebook being a technology company what I m really interested in is you know ho how all this works right scientifically and technologically So I m really curious to hear what is your your favorite or what do you find to be the most interesting uh piece of technology involved in getting to space and operating the space station and and all of what you guys do Um especially something that that the audience who s watching right now might not have might not 00 16 30 be thinking about  Tim Peake Uh wow you know that s an interesting question because actually some of the most exciting uh parts of this mission have been the very basic laugh technology for example the Soyus rocket which hasn t changed much since the 60 s but the I can tell you that was a fairly exciting way to enter earth s orbit Um but of course the space station is constantly being updating using cutting edge technology Um and we had the opportunity uh recently 00 17 00 to actually use virtual reality technology around the space station which is quite incredible to put this uh you know this headset on and to actually um you ll say weigh points around the space station that remain where you put uh you can use view procedures for example I have 3D mapping of the space station I have ground mission control being able to point things out to you So that really has got a a a large potential for future operations I think on board and it s something that s uh quite exciting   All right well 00 17 30 I just want to take a moment to think you guys This has been an incredible experience Um it s the first Facebook Live we ve ever done uh with people from from outer space or well well in outer space um and it s amazing laugh that this worked Uh and so it s a it s a testament to all of the technology and and work that folks at NASA are doing and everything that you guys are doing um to make it so we could really push the frontiers of what humanity understands and and can explore So um you know from someone 00 18 00 here on earth uh thank you for all of the work that you re doing uh it s really important and um I hope the rest of the trip goes well uh and safely and that you you uh learn a lot of good stuff from the experiments that you re doing Thank you so much  Tim Kopra Thank you mark it s been a pleasure talking with you take care  Station Station this is Houston ACR that concludes the event Thank you  Station  00 18 30 Thank you Facebook Station we are now resuming operational audio communication '}\n"

      "{'filename': '2016-016', 'content': '  Hey everyone uh we re live from Facebook headquarters uh for the first ever uh live Q A that we ve done as a community together Uh so you know I ve been going around the world and um and doing some town hall Q As uh to learn from people around the community uh what you wanna hear from Facebook uh wh what you what you wanna to see on Facebook and um what we can be doing better to serve you And you know we we ve done about 10 of these 00 00 30 um as I go around the world to different cities And you know recently we ve launched this new product Live uh which allows us to hear from from people um all over the world live And you know I I have been The these town hall Q As have been modeled off of um Q internal Q As that I ve been doing at Facebook for for for many years now And a few weeks ago I I started off trying to do um an internal live Q A 00 01 00 and I found that it was just so much more fun and engaging and I could see people s comments as I was going Um so rather than just having you know a few hundred or a few thousand people in a room uh we could do this here and we could have you know tens or hundreds of thousands of people participating in a town hall Q A together all across the world Um and it seemed like just a great opportunity uh to give this a shot ah and to see how this goes so I could here from more of you at the same time and um and and see if we can have 00 01 30 a better dialogue this way So you know this is going to be this is more of a trial you know I ve never tried anything of this scale before I think doing a Q A uh when you have tens or you know up to you know 100 000 or more people commenting at once uh is is kind of a new thing so you re um you re gonna have to forgive me if I don t get to all of the comments here I or or even if I it it may even be a bit distracting to look at it Uh but but here s what I m gonna do So I I posted last week 00 02 00 talking about that we re gonna do this Q A and I I asked for some of the questions that you guys wanted to ask and I asked you guys to like uh the the top questions that you want me to go through So I have uh on my laptop up here right below um some of the top questions And what I m gonna do is I m gonna just go through and answer as many as I can and I m gonna look at the comments that you guys are posting as we go and um and try to respond to them as well so this can be a bit more interactive rather than me just going through and asking the questions All right 00 02 30 so uh let s see how this goes and let s uh let s get to it Um so all right now before we get into the questions today um on a more serious note I wanna call out a comment uh from one Pablo uh Corzo from Deerfield Beach in in Florida here in the the US uh about the terrible tragedy uh that happened this weekend in Orlando And one says you know We all together need 00 03 00 to start using social media and technology uh to find solutions to humanity s problems and to work together towards peace and we all need to act together now And you know that comment struck me because I completely a agree with that and I feel like that s what we need to do as a community And you know one of the things that I m so proud of that our community does is whenever there s a tragedy around the world uh we always find a way to come together And whether that was 00 03 30 the earthquake in uh you know in in Nepal where our community raised a record breaking amount of money to support the people who are victims there Uh in the last few days we ve seen that again where so many people uh have expressed support uh for the victims and and their families Um we have complete strangers sending out links uh telling people how they can donate blood and support the people uh the victims and their families So 00 04 00 you know we re going to keep the the all the people who were affected victims and the uh whole LGDP uh L LGBT community uh in in our thoughts and prayers uh from Orlando Uh unfortunately there was another attack uh just last night in in France where a police officer was and and his family were attacked and um there were really sad attacks like this going on all around the world So um we re gonna keep them in in our thoughts and prayers uh and I just wanted to say something up top about 00 04 30 this before we get into the the Q A because I know it s on so many of our minds and and it s really important And I m really proud of our community for coming together and doing what we can to to support uh these folks So all right now now I m going to get to the rest of the questions on on the the laptop uh below And the the top voted question uh on on the thread with i i it had more than a thousand votes um is It s a it s a product 00 05 00 question a feature request Could you please give us folders to store stuff and uh find it easily like recipes please Uh that s from Maria Kennedy in um in Sydney Australia and it had uh more than a a thousand votes And you know one of the things that I love is a as I do these town hall Q As and you know go go across the world to different places I find that the questions that people in our community ask are are so different from um the the type of questions that you 00 05 30 you get in a typical interview I on on TV or or in the media And you know so many people in our community they they ask about very specific product questions and um feature requests and things that they wanna see And um and that I and and so it s actually not a surprise that this is the top voted question So you know will we give folders um to store stuff and and find it easily So here s how here s how we think about this There were all these different types of things 00 06 00 that people care about there are day to day moments with your friends and family um eh almost everyone has an interest or something that they care about or multiple interests and we wanna create spaces and tools uh for you to share everything that you care about with everyone who you want And you know some of the time that s gonna be um you know taking a photo or a video and sharing that into newsfeed uh so that your friends can see it Sometimes that s going to mean publishing something to the the whole world like uh you know this 00 06 30 live Q A where um lots of people can participate in at once it s a completely public thing But you know some of the time that also means um you know sharing into more private or more topical spaces all right So uh one on one message uh thread that you have with your mother or a group for your family or um or for your church or a soccer team or um You know one of the groups that I m in all right and I have this this crazy little Hungarian Sheepdog um 00 07 00 it s called a Puli he s uh really an adorable dog He um his name is Beast you can look him up on Facebook he s got a page Um he actually has quite the the cult following Um and and I just love Pulis so I mean I m a member of of a bunch of Puli groups so I can see all the different content and share different content about about Beast uh wi wi without bothering my friends because I m sharing too much So you know when it comes to things like cooking and and recipes and being able to store these and have a safe space where you can share them with people who care um we re working 00 07 30 on products like that Um you know groups for example has more than a billion people um using it around the world to engage in in groups around their topics and things that they care about So uh that um so I think that s that s a a good first question to to kick this off um is is a bit uh is is is a bit light Um all right I I m looking at some of the questions that are that are coming in um there there s some there s some pretty good ones Uh 00 08 00 especially you know one of the crazy things that when you do this live Q As is some of them are very silly So we got one Mark are the allegations true that you re secretly a lizard Um I m gonna I m gonna have to go with no on that I I I am I am not a lizard but you know keep the high quality comments coming in please This is surely on track to be a great live Q A if we if we continue getting stuff at that level of quality Um there s actually a lot of funny stuff 00 08 30 in here in here too Um I m go I m gonna go to one from um Pamela Spiteri um I m so proud that you talk about education uh what worries what worries you about education and and technology and what um and how can we as educators help out with with limited resources And this is from a teacher uh from Malta which is an an island in in Europe Um so you know for those of you who follow my my page you know that education is something that I care really deeply about And in our 00 09 00 uh my philanthropy work that I do with my wife a lot of what we invest in is uh is education and and making it so that um everyone around the world can have great opportunities for their future And one of the things that I m most excited about um the Right now is personalized learning right It s this idea that if you think about how education has worked for the last you know a hundred years really or or maybe even more you know m most of us probably you know grew up sitting in a classroom um where you know we we 00 09 30 probably had some really great teachers but you know because of the tools that they had uh we were all learning the same thing at the same time in in a lecture So that meant that you know whether if if you understood a concept quickly uh you had to sort of spend the same amount of time on it as someone um who who needed a little more help to get through that And what personalized learning does is it means that everyone can spend exactly the amount of time that they need to understand a concept um and they can learn it using the formats that uh that make the most sense to them So if you learn 00 10 00 best by watching videos or um or by reading or by working together with other people or by doing practice problems you should be able to do whatever um works the best for you And what we re seeing in a lot of the early personalized learning work is it s just producing great uh great education results where you know the people who get who get the concepts quickly can just blow through them and uh and can um and get on to more concepts and can learn more uh faster Uh people who who find something a little bit challenging can take some more time 00 10 30 on it can take all the time that they need to master the concept Um people who who learn better by you know watching videos or playing games or whatever it is can do that And in some cases we ve seen that personalized learning um in in in schools um people can learn as much as 50 more uh than they would otherwise That s for for every year that they re in school they get an extra half a year of learning So I I m really excited about bringing these kinda tools um to everyone across the world because I think that that is going to give everyone 00 11 00 um a more equal opportunity to excel in the things that they care about so I m really excited about that All right now I m going to go back to this um this list of questions because there are some really good ones that people asked on the thread uh earlier in the week that that I m um that I m excited to get to And this th this one is about Um it s from uh Shiba Jolly 00 11 21 uh in who lives in Louisville Kentucky in the US And the question is How can technology uh add to global 00 11 30 optimism uh in a world that is affected by terrorism with the refugee crisis uh geopolitical and economic tensions and and how can we encourage human beings to live happy uh productive and and stable lives And you know this is one that that I uh think a lot about right because you know a lot of what we re trying to do here at Facebook is is help the world come together to be this global community Right our mission is uh to make 00 12 00 the world more open and connected So we talk about how do we connect people around the world together and how do we open up the world to everyone um so that everyone can can participate in in all the opportunities uh that the world has to offer And you know if you think about the history of humanity is really this long arc of uh people um using technology um to to be able to come together and and overcome uh problems 00 12 30 at at at bigger scales right and im im improve the quality of life for for everyone So you know human civilization started off we were uh you know we were hunter gatherers right and uh we lived in these tribes of you know probably no more than about a hundred people and um and then over time you know we we developed you know new technology like agriculture You don t really think about that as technology today but from that perspective it was and and that allowed us to settle into villages and in cities And 00 13 00 um and and over time we developed more technology in terms of how we can trade and work together at a larger scale and we developed into into nations And um and at each s step along the way um you know the our communities were able to have more people uh and the our quality of life got better and you know we lived for longer and we lived safer and and healthier lives Um and you know now I I think that we re we re at this next point in um in in human civilization where we have 00 13 30 the next set of tools that we that we need things like the internet um that that can be this global communication infrastructure Um but I I think we need to move just like we we went from kind of hunter gatherers to villages and cities and then nations I think we now need to come together as a global community because a lot of the problems that you re talking about you know whether it s terrorism um or the refugee crisis or climate change um or global diseases spreading around the world these are not things that can 00 14 00 be solved uh by you know any one city or one nation or one small group of people They inherently affect everyone around the world So you know what I think that that we need to be doing as a technology industry and a community is trying to build this technology so that just like in every other point in history uh people can come together and and kind of level up humanity um and get to the next level and start to see ourselves um less as just nations of people and more as a global community of um 00 14 30 of everyone living together and trying to take on these problems And you know at each one of these steps in the past um it s required new technology um it s required new political systems and written ways of doing things in order to organize everyone together Um so it s it s um not gonna be easy we have a lot of work to do But I think that in in the 21st century we all need to start thinking about ourselves um more as citizens of of the world in order to solve some of these problems than just as people who live in you know one specific country 00 15 00 um or city And you know so tha that I think is is is the biggest part of it is is how do we connect in and come together and build this kind of global community um and and build the global infrastructure towards that The the other piece that I think is really important is how do we open up all the opportunities of the world to everyone Right so you know we talk about you know how how can everyone have access to education right and health and You know so much of that because we need to make it so that I i that this kind of global 00 15 30 infrastructure goes everywhere And one one of the parts that I m really passionate about is spreading connectivity right because you know the internet it doesn t solve all problems but um but but it does help out with a lot of things Um and you know because if if you re living in i in a village that doesn t have access to good education then the the internet is probably one of your best shots at being able to look up the the information that you need uh to be able to get a good education Or you know if you um you know you have a child and you re trying 00 16 00 to take care of your child and you live in a place that you don t have access to a good doctor um the internet is is a good bet uh for you to be able to look up the information you need to be able to safely uh raise your kid And today you know more than half of the world is not on the internet and I I think spreading infrastructure like the internet spreading education around the world spreading um healthcare and and all the the things that we know through modern science um to open up all the opportunities of the world um to everyone is one of the big things that we need 00 16 30 to accomplish um as a global community in in this century right And we really should I mean there s there s great inequality in the world today but I really do believe that if we come together as a global community and um and we develop the technology to to um a and an infrastructure to be able to do that then I think we re going to make a lot of progress towards uh pushing on these problems and opening up uh the world to everyone a around the whole world All right um let s I m I m scanning these um these comments here uh 00 17 00 and let s let s go to There there there are a few topics that that I want to touch on then we got then we got a few questions on upfront about some of the long term um innovation things that Facebook is working on around um AI and non connectivity and and and future computing platforms like VR and AR Um so let s I wanna d uh oh I m gonna take a question uh now from the the thread earlier about about AI 00 17 30 and accessibility And this is from Abdul Aziz in Barcelona in Spain and the question is you know What about artificial intelligence uh would be the the the next impact of Facebook on the world right because there are millions of people around the globe who are physically challenged uh for example blind um who and they can t access the internet So that that s the question Now um you know AI is one of the areas that O of technology that I m I m the most excited about for Facebook 00 18 00 And you know it fits into the steam that we were just talking about of how do you open uh the opportunities of the world to everyone right And you know I actually I did this live uh about a month ago with one of our engineers here um who s actually he s he s a blind engineer and um and he s working on this AI technology at Facebook to make it so that um Facebook can look at a photo and um can see what s in it and if you re if you re blind 00 18 30 and you can t see your newsfeed um it can actually read out loud to you uh what is in the photos So you re just scrolling through your news feed and it can say Hey here s a photo of these friends and they re at a beach Or Here s like here s a photo of two friends and and they re they re cooking dinner And you know that s an amazing advance that that uses AI uh to understand what s going on in a sce in a scene and can bring that opportunity to uh to just hundreds of of of millions of folks around 00 19 00 the world who otherwise wouldn t have the ability to see Um and you can imagine very similar things uh will also be possible with um with with audio too right for people who can t hear So for example um we we re working on AI technology that can you know for people who are deaf uh can uh look at the videos like this one is there playing and um and can just add subtitles to them automatically right and and can understand uh what s going on So that way i if for you know some reason if you re one of the the 00 19 30 hundreds of millions of people who who can t hear you can now um hear essentially by by seeing what is going on in these videos in a way that you couldn t before And and by the way this stuff is really valuable um even for people who are not uh visually or um impaired or or or or deaf as well um because you know a lot of us are browsing news feed in in our phones with with the volume off anyway right We re in public places uh where we don t necessarily wanna um like bother all the people 00 20 00 around us by having the audio on So you know how often do you have this experience where you re in newsfeed and you come across a video and the sound is off and you don t necessarily want to tap on it um to go in because you re in a public place and you want to bug people But now because of this AI technology uh that that that um that we ve developed that can that can listen and and can start to automatically subtitle things in the near future um you re gonna be able to see what people are saying in those videos even without the audio turned on So and like some of the stuff is just really exciting in terms of opening 00 20 30 uh the world up to everyone and and making sure that everyone can participate in in all of these opportunities All right so let s take a look at um at ah at a bunch of these questions that are that are coming in Um we got one from a a woman Crystal Carrier Are we really going to have to pay for Facebook um because I remember at one point uh that you said that that was never going to happen is this just a rumor that s spamming Facebook And the answer is uh you will never have 00 21 00 to pay for Facebook Um we ve we ve made a commitment Facebook is free it always will be uh this is part of our mission to make it so that we can build a a global community so that everyone can be a part of it uh and to make sure that we can open up the opportunities of the world up to everyone in the world We wanna uh make sure that everyone can afford to use our service and we re not going to charge which is why we re we re ad supported And you know we try to make it so that we have um as high quality and great uh ads as possible as the service but that that s how we keep the service 00 21 30 free for everyone and build a a a strong business that we we can continue investing in building um more things All right so um I m gonna I m gonna keep on going through some of the questions here Um you know let s go to a a question about VR here Uh this is from Mats Leksell in in Stockholm in Sweden um Are are you planning on integrating more VR into Facebook in the future and if so what do you hope that VR will bring uh to 00 22 00 Facebook So you know a lot of what we re trying to do here is give everyone in the world the the power uh to share exactly what they re experiencing and thinking um with anyone else right So you know if you go back to the internet 10 years ago most of what we shared online was text right I mean i it was the internet was very slow it was very hard to uh to get visual media um so most of what we were doing was text And 00 22 30 you know since then you know now we we all have phones uh or most of us do that have cameras so we take a lot of photos And now as as our internet and networks are getting better we can start to support more video right We can upload videos uh we can we can do this live like like we re doing here And um and that is just making this experience richer and richer and you re getting a better sense of what people are are experiencing and feeling around the world and um and it s just really powerful But the question that you have to ask is is 00 23 00 is video the end of the line Right is that as good as we can do in terms of capturing a scene and and what someone is experiencing at that point in time And um and and I think that the answer to that is definitely no right Because technology can always get better we can always do a better job of giving everyone a voice making it so that everyone can share exactly what there thinking And to me that s what VR is about It s about presence right feeling like you re really there with someone right And this live video is is great and we we ve done anything like it before and 00 23 30 it probably gives you you know more a feeling that you re here with me than um than if you just watched a video afterwards or uh you know if you know uh historically We would we would just be in a position where we d have you know a hundred or a thousand people in a room and then kind of that would be it but now we we have you know more than 100 000 people I think are are are watching this so that s kind of a new thing But VR will give a new kind of presence um where you know you ll be able to capture a whole scene in 360 We ve started doing these 360 videos and photos 00 24 00 I shared one yesterday of of this conference room I mean go check it out on my profile We could just pan around and you can feel it feels like you re really there in in the in the room And you know in the future I think just like this live Q A is um better and you feel more present uh here than than we were able to do before um I think the future it will just get even better with VR right So in in a few years maybe we ll we ll we ll all be able to um all actually physically be together in the same space uh in in VR Maybe we ll have some kind of VR amphitheater 00 24 30 and we ll have a a VR Q A Um I look forward to that uh but tha that I think this is is where this is all going It just i it s going on this this historical trend towards people getting the power to share what uh they re feeling and thinking um in much more detail over time text photos to videos to whole scenes to to even more beyond that Um okay so actually here s here s a good follow up question to to that that I see Um this is from from Sa Sadipt uh Deuvedi 00 24 58 00 25 00 in Kanpur India Uh and the question is How is Facebook gonna transform itself um uh s to to keep up with new ideas and technology in ways to communicate Uh I know that virtual reality is an interesting start um but you know what what s beyond that Um so you know just like I said that I You know you go from text to photos to videos and that s not the end of the line there s going to be something like VR that can that can help us um share what s going on and l like the whole scene around us 00 25 30 Um I I actually I don t think VR and AI are the end of the line either um you know virtual reality Uh there s always something that goes beyond that And you know some of the stuff starts to get really sci fi and and crazy But let me give you three examples of um of of science research that are going on that are that are real today Um and you you know what I think we re going to get to at the end at the end of the line past VR is a is a world where you know i more than just being able to capture what s going on in a scene um 00 26 00 I think you re going to be able to just be able to capture a thought right What you re you re thinking or feeling in its kind of ideal and and perfect form um in your head and be able to share that with the world in a way in a format where they can they can get that And um there s some pretty crazy um brain research that i that is going on uh that suggests that that we might be able to do this at some point maybe maybe probably decades down the line But there there s this uh team at at at Berkeley um right around here 00 26 30 uh that s doing this research where you know they can take an MRI right eh of of of your brain and and do an image of it and um and they can they can take an MRI of you watching different things So watching different TV programs looking at a dog a cat uh doing different activities And then you know they can take those activities away and they can just do an MRI of your your brain and they can and they tell you i i And then they they can predict what you re thinking about and what image um you re seeing in your mind s eye 00 27 00 um just by doing the MRI and looking at the brain pattern And you know that s obviously pretty far off and you know there are a lot of technology and advances that um that are going to need to happen before that could be safe to use and something that you actually wanna do uh and and all that But I I do think that in the future we will have the ability to um to just capture um kind of a raw emotion or um or thought that we have and and if if and when you want it and how you want it of course it s really important that people have the power uh to do 00 27 30 this in the way that they want be able to um to share that with other people And you know there s also some pretty crazy research I think there was a um a a paper I I forget where I read this uh but I think that the the government was doing some research on on on memories and mice Where uh you They they basically they had a mouse go through a maze and it eh encoded the memory of how to go through the maze in its head And um and then they were actually able to take uh the representation of that memory 00 28 00 and kind of and zap another mouse and put that memory into that other mouse Um and it s um I mean that s pretty crazy stuff And then that mouse without actually having ever been through the maze uh was able to uh go do it And you know so that that s just kinda straight up in The Matrix right And that s really far off I mean no one s doing that on humans Um but I think that it s it s a You know in the future you know there were all these ethical questions and all these interesting questions about how you do that well um and and how you give people power so that they can 00 28 30 do this in a way that they that they want But having the ability the raw ability over time um to be able to share a pure thought or feeling in the way that you want um and give you control over that I think it s something that you know 50 years from now may not be laughs a crazy thing to to think about So um anyhow we re we re not working on that but um but that s a thing that down the line um may may be possible Okay um let s look at um here here s a here s a fun question This i this one is about um live video 00 29 00 So it s um it s from Adrian Burnett in in Greenville uh South Carolina uh here in the US And the the question is I love the live feed that lets you interact with people on a more personal level and so thank you for that And uh you re welcome Adrian I am glad you re enjoying it Um is there anything in the works to improve uh the live feed And um and the answer is is yes Uh this is a there s a big area that we re working Um the experience that we re having now together I I think is is really cool and and interesting and and fun that we 00 29 30 can do this uh but you know but I think there are a lot of things that would be a lot better So for example you know Adrian when you asked that question you know rather than me just seeing it on a comment and and being able to to read it I mean how cool would it be if you could just pop in uh and and and be on the video with me for 10 seconds to ask that and we can chat back and forth and people could drop in But you know live one of the reasons why I m so excited about this is it s a completely new format it s not it s not just video 00 30 00 right because we re actually we re interacting right Like there are people all around the world who are writing in comments and um and were we re hanging out right we re chatting and this this isn t just a one way thing where I have a camera and I m recording and some people are watching it Um this is actually w we we re able to just I I can go live and and create the space where we can hang out together Um and people can just pop in and um and comment and in the future I think it would be awesome if I could see more of you guys um see what you re up to while we re doing 00 30 30 this if you want and people can just jump in and and hang out in in different ways while while we re doing this So we re gonna get there we have a we have a long road map of things to make this better um but it s really early days We just started rolling this out um I think i i just a matter of months ago and already a lot of people are using it So I m really excited about live and I m I m glad that you are too Um okay so in in the similar to this question about about uh live videos one of the other new um new video formats 00 31 00 that we ve rolled out recently is 360 videos And um we have a a a question from Vick Croatia 00 31 06 in in Cypress California here in the US and it s eh 360 videos are incredible um I just couldn t believe what I was watching how how do you do this So I I m not sure how much of a technical explanation uh you want on this But the the short answer is um 360 videos and 360 photos are a bit different To make a 360 video because you re you re capturing the scene 00 31 30 as it s happening um you need to have multiple cameras pointed in different directions Um so you can do it as simply as just having two cameras you know one pointed that way and one going in the other direction And or you can have these really professional complex rigs uh like one that Facebook designed that have as many as you know maybe 36 cameras on it that really capture every direction and and a lot of detail And then you look at all the video streams and basically you just use a bunch of math to stitch them all together and create one file And then you can use the 00 32 00 the gyroscope on the on the phone so that as you tilt around or look around in different directions uh we know um and and can map where you should be in the video to um to the orientation that you re looking at Now the videos require a little bit more professional production You can buy a 360 video camera um there there are plenty online um but 360 photos which I think are actually potentially even cooler um which we just launched 00 32 30 in the last couple of weeks that anyone in the world can do just from your phone right I mean I posted one of of my conference room I posted uh one from uh that that someone else took of of New York City and that I mean you you literally just take your phone and you you pan it around the room like you re just doing a normal panorama photo um and then you just upload that to Facebook and we ll take care of the rest of the math there Um so you can you can create an an awesome 360 photo uh just that way by yourself So that s uh that s pretty cool Um 00 33 00 okay somewhat of a of a different question but again uh getting into feature request uh Ville here We we have a question from um Clark Vista in Manila in the Philippines and the question is Would you ever create uh consider creating a Facebook app that is a lighter version Uh so this just makes browsing much faster and saves data from our network And um so Clark uh you re in luck because we we actually have this 00 33 30 um it s called Facebook Lite so you even got the name right in your question when you asked if we re going to build a a lighter version of Facebook And um its it you can you can find it in in um in the app stores on um on Android And uh it s exactly what you say what what you re asking for It s um it s a smaller file right so you can download it it takes up less space on your phone um if you don t have a lot of space And um and it goes faster uses less data and it tries to be more efficient and in order to do that it um you know the some 00 34 00 of features of the full Facebook app aren t there but if what what you re looking for is a light and fast experience um that s the app that you want And there are tens of millions of people using it around the world um who I think have the same question that you have So um so go check it out Okay um let s see what what e what else is going on in the thread I m gonna take a second just to scan this and and read through Um l l let s see Um 00 34 30 all right so here s one Um this is an entrepreneurship question from Arvind uh Kanapan 00 34 38 um Who s been your biggest advisor since you started the company and what obstacles have you faced along the journey uh to where you are now And you know I think this question of who are your mentors or advisors is 00 35 00 a pretty common um question from from entrepreneurs right Because people you know everyone has dreams of of what they wanna do and the question is eh like Where do I go seek out advice to get that And you know w w what I ve always found to be true is there are lots of smart people around the world who you can get advice from But the people who I ve learned the most from are not some people who I just talked to you know every few months who are advisors or mentors to me although I really value those relationships 00 35 30 too uh but the people I work with every day right So you know people who are on um just the core management team at Facebook um some of the best engineers that we have here and product thinkers and designers you know those are the people who I m working with day in and day out um on the on the work that we re doing um who are are out building new things and learning new things and we re sharing our perspective every day So I actually think if you wanna think about how to build something great 00 36 00 um or or really e even if you re not trying to be an entrepreneur but really in anything you do I think you should ask yourself this question of How much am I learning from the people around me who I m working with Because you know most of your learning um is gonna come from them right it s not gonna come from you know some uh mentor that you have somewhere else even even if that s a a cool opportunity for you it s the people who you surround yourself with on a day to day basis who are really gonna determine um a lot of what you learn and the perspective that you end up seeing  00 36 30 Um and that can be an intentional choice that you make is who do you who do you wanna surround yourself with um what kind of an environment do you want to be in And if you re in an environment where you know you re not learning as much as as you think you should be um if you don t have uh the people around you who who you think are going to inspire you to do uh the the best work that you can then the then think about changing something Because um you know that s a that s a that s a big deal And in in my work here certainly I ve learned more from you know our core team uh you know folks like Cheryl 00 37 00 and Chris Cox who runs product here and you know Javier uh who runs all of growth and analytics and and Mike Schroepfer who uh you know who s our Chief Technology Officer at the company Um you know that s that s kind of the core crew of people um who I mean I ve worked with most of them for almost 10 years and and I learn more from them than any than any external mentor Um okay um let s let s look at the thread again We got here is some some kind of funny um Here here s a good one I love 00 37 30 this This is from Nate Bruner uh right here in Palo Alto so so right nearby where where we are uh in California in the US And and I love this one The question is Hey Mark uh my friends and I are living in Palo Alto at your old house in Barron Park Uh we wanted to know which room you stayed in during your stay at 819 which is the the address of of the house Um and you know that one brings back some memories When I uh when I first moved out here um 00 38 00 I I was a Harvard student I d just finished my my sophomore year And you know I I d actually I had been kinda of on the East Coast for for a few years straight and you know I thought Hey wouldn t it be awesome to spend the summer out in in Palo Alto right Palo Alto is kind of this magical place in Silicon Valley where all these startups come from and you know at the time I didn t actually think that um that Facebook was gonna We w I wasn t focused on building it into a big company I just I wanted to help connect folks 00 38 30 who are in college who wanted to um to see what was going on with their friends and um and share with them And you know I thought that it would be awesome to come out here and and learn for the summer So we got this little summer sublet um at this house that that apparently Nate you re staying in Which by the way eh to answer your question before I continue with the story i when you enter into the house I m assuming you re coming in from the road if you go uh if you if you go to the the right wing of the house where um there s a there s a couple of bedrooms down there um i it s all the way 00 39 00 down the the hallway on the on the right side I think it s the the further bedroom is the one that I stayed in And it and that was that was a good time Um so you know we got we got the summer sublet out here and you know we just stayed in in the house we didn t have an office Um and we just kind of all stayed around this kitchen table me Dustin my co founder um a a handful of other folks and um folks who were working with us for the summer And we built a lot of the early features of Facebook um we built the wall um we built groups 00 39 30 and events Um we worked that summer to spread Facebook to more than a hundred more schools And it w wa it was a lot of fun a lot of good stuff happened at that house that brings back some some fun memories Um I m glad that uh that uh that that you brought that up so um so good luck to whoever is staying in in that that zone Um okay I think um let s let s go back to the the thread and see see what people are um are asking now Um 00 40 00 right here here s another one around entrepreneurship It s from Biruts Mark 00 40 05 uh in Jaipur India If you have to start all over again as a teenager uh what would you like to take up as your startup Um that s a a very uh that s a It s a good question Um you know the the way that I think about building a company is it s all about what change do you wanna make in the world Um 00 40 30 you know I started Facebook not as a company but because I wanted to help connect people at my college right And um and I wanted to give people the power to share what was going on with them in their in their lives and that s really what I care about right I mean it s this whole idea that we talked about earlier of making the world more open and connected How do you connect people and bring people together towards a a global community um and how do you open up the opportunities of the world so that everyone in the world can participate And you know if um if I had to start 00 41 00 over today um you know I think Facebook would look different You know I mean I started as um Sorry I I got the hiccups randomly Um I I uh i you know I wouldn t start it as a website today I I think you you d start you d start whatever you were building as a mobile app Um you know today more than a billion people um use Facebook on their mobile phones and um you know and and that s obviously the more important way that people are accessing the internet and communicating with each other today so that would be different 00 41 30 But you know I I often you know tell tell folks that you know if I had to start over if you just dropped me in the middle of a desert somewhere um or in the middle of a jungle I would probably first try to figure out my way out um and then I would start working on connecting people around the world Um because that is laughs what I care about Um and you know I don t know exactly what the right strategy would be to get started today I think it would be more around mobile um or or some some future technology 00 42 00 um than building a website like when I got started But you know so much of entrepreneurship Don t think about it as building a company right I think that s actually the biggest mistake that people make is they they decide they wanna build a company uh rather than um thinking about what change they wanna make in the world Once you know what change you wanna make in the world all of the tactics and strategy for how you do that um just fit into that change Um and th that I think is is the key thing and you know no matter what situation I m in I think bringing people together um and using technology to help um 00 42 30 open up the the opportunities of the world for for people is that s just what I m passionate about and that s what what I would what I would do Um all right now you know I posted this 360 photo yesterday of my conference room and if you looked at it you could see that you know it s all glass uh and like part of that is it s the symbol of our open culture uh here that people can just walk around and see what s going on But that also means that I can look out and see what s going on and you know we have all kinds of interesting people 00 43 00 uh who come by and visit the office And I think I just caught someone out of the corner of my eye um who I m gonna go uh pull in for a second because I uh I think that this is gonna be fun So uh i give me a second give me give me 15 seconds to go grab him Um I don t actually know maybe he s in he s in the middle of a meeting or something But I I m gonna I m gonna see if I can pull this off so give me one moment and I I ll be right back  Jerry Seinfeld What s going on Mark   Hey  Jerry Seinfeld What are you doing here   What do you 00 43 30 think  Jerry Seinfeld  Laughs   Come on in  Jerry Seinfeld What are you   You got a live video this this afternoon  Jerry Seinfeld I do   At the square  Jerry Seinfeld I do   All right all right I thought I thought I found someone o o o of interest here We got um  Jerry Seinfeld What is this    Mr Mr Jerry Seinfeld  Jerry Seinfeld Hi   How s it going  Jerry Seinfeld I m doing great Mark it s great to meet you    Laughs It s good to meet you too  Jerry Seinfeld I had no idea you would be here Laughs    Laughs Um I I m supposed to say  Jerry Seinfeld Yes right   That s um that s 00 44 00 that s  Jerry Seinfeld That s why it s funny when I say it   Um uh yeah well you re the comedian  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah   Um so no what are what are what are you doing here  Jerry Seinfeld I m doing a uh Oculus demonstration I m doing a Q A on Facebook Live today and we re showing the first episode of the new season of Comedians in Cars just to employees of Facebook That s not gonna be on air today   Uh all right I m a I m a fan of that  Jerry Seinfeld Thank you   So did you did you do the oculus demo already or you  Jerry Seinfeld I did the Oculus demo yeah   So wha what do you know think We gotta we gotta start there  Jerry Seinfeld I 00 44 30 I loved it I really really loved it I really thought it was uh funny and stimulating it was one of those things that you can t react to in the moment you have to I I have to think about that I could tell you better tomorrow what I thought of it   Okay and you got to you got to do the hands demo too the Oculus crosstalk crosstalk 00 44 49  Jerry Seinfeld I did the hands thing I could hold things I drew things   So that s coming out later in the year that s actually not a um I mean we we we ve demoed it publicly but it s People can t buy that one yet Um I I m really looking forward to that I think 00 45 00 when that g it s it s just much more compelling when you can actually change the world and interact with other people Um so I think I think that ll be that ll be good And and you re gonna do a live Q A you said here  Jerry Seinfeld We re doing a live Q A yeah we re gonna show the first episode of uh Comedians in Cars Season Eight and then we re gonna do a live Q A on Facebook   All right okay So um so while we re here we I I think we have like 10 or 15 more minutes in this Q A you wanna you wanna take some questions with me  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah sure what have we got   All right so um so we got some Uh on on this screen we have 00 45 30 the top voted uh questions that that that that people submitted and voted on um in the week leading up to this And then on this screen here we have all the live comments as people are pouring in um the ones that that people are voting on as well Um so here we should just we should just pick one up and we go for it  Jerry Seinfeld No I I don t find any of these interesting at all   All right well then improvise  Jerry Seinfeld What I I I what I would like to know first of all I d like to know what time you woke up   This morning 6 AM because  Jerry Seinfeld 6 AM okay now   Which is not normal but Max um 00 46 00 is like a a pterodactyl and it s uh she um I mean I i it s like I didn t know a human could make those noises Um it s but but I guess that s the way it goes I I was never a morning person um Max is definitely turning me into a morning person um  Jerry Seinfeld So you get out of bed   Oh I didn t say that  Jerry Seinfeld Oh   You asked me when I woke up  Jerry Seinfeld Yo yo I see so you wake up and you stay in bed    Laughs Well yeah you know someone s gotta go um g g gotta go calm her down But um um 00 46 30  Jerry Seinfeld And then what do you do   This morning I um I went for a short run  Jerry Seinfeld Okay before that I wanna know the very first thing you do You get out of the bed you go to the bathroom   Oh I don t know uh no The first thing I do is to look at my phone laughs  Jerry Seinfeld Oh you look at the phone first okay    Laughs Yes yes yeah  Jerry Seinfeld That s interesting I do that too And what do you wanna know on I usually wanna know did the Mets win or not that s what I wanna know first when I open my eyes   Oh no that s that s not my thing I m not I m not that although I m  Jerry Seinfeld I know I m asking you what you do   Um 00 47 00 I I look at Facebook uh to see to see what s going on in the world  Jerry Seinfeld Right right right   Um and I and I check uh my messages I look at Messenger and WhatsApp  Jerry Seinfeld And how long how many minutes would you say you spend before you go I gotta go to the bathroom   It depends on Um you know it depends on what s going on in the world On a on a good calm day um I ll it ll probably be no more than a few minutes um on  Jerry Seinfeld Right so you stay in the bed or you sit up on the edge of the bed   Yeah you s um yeah I think it s um 00 47 30 it s I m lying down I m lying down  Jerry Seinfeld You re not sure   It s on it s on the the night table and I just pull it in and it s it s actually a pretty sad situation to be honest because I I have contacts right I mean I can t see that well  Jerry Seinfeld Right right me too   Um and before I put my contacts in I often go look um to see what s going on on Facebook too But I m I m very nearsighted so I m like eh I ve got to put the phone So that um that s uh probably not my uh my best moment  Jerry Seinfeld No it s not anybody s   But I mean I wasn t planning on talking about this publicly but um crosstalk 00 47 59  Jerry Seinfeld Well that s what I 00 48 00 like to do is uh this is what I m interested in   Okay  Jerry Seinfeld And then do you take a shower or you re gonna You work out first Oh you said you were going for a run   Yeah no you you I think that the better strategy is to work out and then you shower I think um  Jerry Seinfeld Not Barack Obama he likes to shower   And then work out  Jerry Seinfeld  And shave and work out which I found to be very odd   That doesn t make any sense  Jerry Seinfeld It doesn t make any sense   I guess you could do that if you were a president  Jerry Seinfeld But he said to me I m the President and I do what I want   That yeah so it s  Jerry Seinfeld And I I didn t pursue it after that   Yeah no that s not me I um I 00 48 30 I try to go for go for a run or work out and um that s a good way to start off the day  Jerry Seinfeld That is good that is good okay Uh now this person wants to know are you marathon training Somebody told me that you re gonna run 365 days or something or hours   Yeah so I have I have to p uh I do these personal challenges every year And um and this year I have two One is to run 365 miles 00 49 00 so an average of one mile a day And then the other one is to build  Jerry Seinfeld That is not a challenge a mile a day Laughs   Yeah I know I know so that s That that was the easy one The other one was to build an AI that controls my home  Jerry Seinfeld Okay that s a little more challenging yeah laughs   Yeah so I figured you know doing something physical is good um in order to offset all of the sitting that I m gonna be doing writing writing this AI So the AI is going pretty well I I can now um I can now basically talk into my phone and tell it to turn off the lights or turn up and down the temperature  Jerry Seinfeld  00 49 30 That s good   Or let people in through the gate um you know the the new thing that I m working on is we we have this camera at the gate and um it can now look at uh who s coming up and even before they ring the doorbell um know if I wanna let them in So you know if I m You know take like m my wife for example she s a good one to let in and so she can just walk up and it s like Hey Priscilla come in And so that um that is uh you know that that s a pretty fun one that that were working on Um and you know maybe I ll do a live in a 00 50 00 few weeks demoing some of this stuff  Jerry Seinfeld Right isn t it funny how we work so hard to just eliminate a little bit of effort I mean to get the door is not that much work but we are going to do put in a tremendous amount of work to just save us walking to the door and opening it   Yeah you know this one is the challenge is more about the practice of of writing this code and learning about AI then actually having it Um you know I mean in a few years 00 50 30 I think there ll be better technology that can do a lot of this stuff But I enjoy uh the process of writing something that can understand the language that can understand voice um that can you know do the vision processing of like as someone s walking up to the door it can try to figure out who it is Um and you know th that part is interesting to me and I think you know in running Facebook you know the technology company it s I think also a good practice right I mean if I m completely out of touch with the stuff that people here are doing then I m probably not going to do that good of a job 00 51 00 of running the company so so there s that Then you know the running challenge was supposed to be super easy right it was supposed to be 365 like you said you were you making fun of me a second ago and saying Yeah you should be able to run 365 miles So you re right Um I kind of  Jerry Seinfeld Right I would call that a running pass time or a side project challenge   So but I um I I have a way of making things more intense than they should be So we um  Jerry Seinfeld Right that s good   So we I I started 00 51 30 training at the beginning of the year I wasn t sure how this was gonna go And um and I ve I ve I think it s going too far I ve now I ve now gotten to the point where I can basically just wake up in the morning and um like bang out a half marathon or a marathon if I want So I decided I m actually going to start training for a triathlon all right so like all right  Jerry Seinfeld Really   Instead of just doing instead of just doing running um let s do biking um and swimming too So I went to the bike shop last weekend um and I didn t even have a bike when I decided to do this  Jerry Seinfeld Right that s a great 00 52 00 smell the bike shop isn t it The rubber and the   Um no I didn t notice any smell  Jerry Seinfeld You didn t notice the smell   No  Jerry Seinfeld Oh   I m not I m not a very  Jerry Seinfeld I love the smell of a bike shop   Well I think it was my first time in a bike shop so so I went and got a bike and on my very first ride So I got these clips right so you know you clip then  Jerry Seinfeld Right I know the clips   If you re going to be a intense bike rider you you go for it I d never done that before  Jerry Seinfeld You gotta have the clips   Um so I went for a ride with my dad and we Like 10 seconds in I we I came to a stop at the stop sign didn t unclip  Jerry Seinfeld Oh God always 00 52 30 happens    Fell braced broke my arm  Jerry Seinfeld This arm is broken   This yeah No it s um I  Jerry Seinfeld It looks a little swollen there   Um yeah well I mean it s it s only a week old but it s um yeah the the radius bone I I just it s a little fracture It s uh very interesting people don t believe me because I don t have a splint or a sling  Jerry Seinfeld Why don t you put it in something   Apparently when you re trying to heal an elbow or a shoulder um if it s not um too too badly separated um the the mobility actually helps it heal more than 00 53 00 um more than just having in a sling that makes it crosstalk 00 53 03 so  Jerry Seinfeld Oh okay well I suggest maybe your next challenge will be 15 second rides so if your last one was 10 let s go for a 15 second bike challenge   Yeah no I mean I I think I need to ease into the triathlon thing I m not My training is not off to a good start on this so uh we ll have to see how this goes  Jerry Seinfeld That s a huge commitment for a guy with the baby a triathlon that s really I mean you re you ve already got it you ve got a baby that s a triathlon 00 53 30 right there   No she likes running with me though  Jerry Seinfeld Oh really In the little thing   Oh yeah yeah she loves it she s like I think she thinks she thinks she s flying  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah I always think kids in those jogging strollers must be thinking We are probably so late or something I don t know where we re going    Laughs Yeah  Jerry Seinfeld So should we answer some questions people wanna ask us   Yeah let s go for it let s take one or two one or three more here  Jerry Seinfeld No one seems to even know that I m here I don t see my name anywhere   Well you do have OMG Jerry Seinfeld  Jerry Seinfeld  00 54 00 Oh yeah   That s not a question that s not really a question  Jerry Seinfeld That s that s Karen Marooney 00 54 05 she needs a challenge also   All right  Jerry Seinfeld Come up with something Karen   Um let s get some let s get some questions for for Jerry here You know um  Jerry Seinfeld What do you wanna know about me uh you must be a little curious about me   Um well so I mean Seinfeld my my understanding of Seinfeld  Jerry Seinfeld That s my show yeah   Eh no you right you you it s it s um you know you re eating a lot of cereal and and  Jerry Seinfeld Yes   So so what do you eat for breakfast  Jerry Seinfeld I don t eat cereal 00 54 30 anymore   What do you what do you crosstalk 00 54 32  Jerry Seinfeld Now I I like to have three eggs because I read an item about this lady in Italy that s 105 and has three eggs for breakfast every morning and I said That sounds good So every day I have three eggs for breakfast and it s a fantastic breakfast holds you like for four hours   Okay um that s a lot of eggs  Jerry Seinfeld Three   Is that is that healthy  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah I think it is laughs   All right I ll I ll take your word for that uh it s not how not what I do All right so let s um this one I think we should be able to have some fun with 00 55 00 It s from a question from John Joseph Contreras in in Menlo Park California which is right where our offices are here Um this is a very neighborly question Um the question is You should totally come out to our block party in Menlo Park crosstalk 00 55 17  Jerry Seinfeld Okay that s a suggestion   Yeah just um your wife and kid are also welcome  Jerry Seinfeld No they re not So okay and again   I don t know see see I have a completely different reaction to that I think that s a really nice question I mean this is what Facebook does crosstalk inaudible 00 55 29  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah w what s the question    00 55 30 Uh will we come to the block party  Jerry Seinfeld I didn t know   Can I send you instead  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah no I No thank you John not interested because what makes that community nice and relaxed is that I m not there    Laughs  Jerry Seinfeld That s what makes it friendly and real that s what he likes about it You and I showing up would ruin everything he likes about that community   Yeah but you know we talk a lot about building global community uh and 00 56 00 I do think that th a big part of of connecting the world and and building a community for everyone is uh also you know starts from from you know local communities and so I don t know I think I think playing a part in our local community is is is uh an important thing for us to do  Jerry Seinfeld What part would we play besides people going Could I take a selfie with you   Well we could eat his food  Jerry Seinfeld Okay    Laughs Or we can bring food  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah no   All right yeah I think you some more some more questions here Um so Jerry what do you think Kramer 00 56 30 would do with Facebook Live And Hi Ben which I don t understand that but you you apparently do  Jerry Seinfeld  Hi Ben no I don t know who Ben is Hi Jerry boy this We gotta    Hey hello what you doing  Jerry Seinfeld  What would Kramer do with Facebook Live You me I w you mean I I don t know Does he mean Michael Richards or does he mean the character Does does he know that it was a fictional show   This is all you get you re not gonna you re not gonna get get clarification for that  Jerry Seinfeld I don t I don t think he would do anything with it He d be on Facebook 00 57 00 because he is a very social person and very into connectivity Your goal was to take the social experience and put it online my goal is to take the actual human social experience and get away from that   Get away  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah to I would like to el eliminate the entire social experin experience   Why That sounds terrible  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah uh because I I don t feel comfortable laughs    Laughs  Jerry Seinfeld Standup comedy is a way 00 57 30 to interact with people in a completely anonymous way unconnected you never meet any of these people you never really It s a completely virt that s the first virtual reality is stand up comedy   Interesting so it seems like we have completely different reactions  Jerry Seinfeld Completely yes    To to dealing with our our social insecurities You uh try to try to project that and um  Jerry Seinfeld How could I get away yeah    And I try and I try to get everyone in the world to to socialize to try and come together Um so 00 58 00 you know All right let s see is there is there one more good one and then and then we should probably wrap up I think we have time for one more question This has been a pretty fun live Q A  Jerry Seinfeld  Laughs   Um I don t know you you you see anything on on here that that you wanna go through  Jerry Seinfeld Oh here s one it s talking about Transcendental Meditation That s something you would love Do you do that   No  Jerry Seinfeld Oh you d love it it s great   Why  Jerry Seinfeld It s uh tremendous energy and relaxation at the same time TM is the ultimate work tool that s how I would sell it    00 58 30 Interesting  Jerry Seinfeld Okay let s move on   All right well that was I think supposed to be the last one  Jerry Seinfeld Oh all right   Other than How about swimming  Jerry Seinfeld  How about swimming   Which I don t I I I think that was probably going back to the triathlon Hard to swim with a broken arm but I ll go I ll be back at it um in a couple months or so Al right  Jerry Seinfeld Can I tell you how many times people here today talked to me about the broken arm   Um well if they probably thought that if we were gonna meet that um that they should warn you not to shake my hand  Jerry Seinfeld Yes that s what they did They really looked after you   Well I appreciate that  Jerry Seinfeld  00 59 00 And don t ask him don t pretend that you know about it but if he brings it up the arm is really broken it s really a big it s a big thing going on at the company today   Um yeah well laughs inaudible 00 59 13 not not not quite sure how to react to that but um you know it s fine it s fine  Jerry Seinfeld Yeah ah laughs it s nice that people care about you   People you know yeah but I also I mean it gives people the People don t kind of know what to do with a broken arm that doesn t at all look broken My wife wants me to put a temporary tattoo on it that says Broken  Jerry Seinfeld That s a great idea   Um so that 00 59 30 I um I mean I I I d actually think it s a terrible idea to be honest  Jerry

      "{'filename': '2016-018', 'content': ' Barack Obama Thank you Applause Hello everybody Thank you so much Thank you Applause Thank you Thank you very much Thank you Everybody have a seat Thank you so much Thank you Thank you so much Well this is a good looking group Thank you Applause Well first of all let me thank President Hennessy for the introduction and the entire Stanford family for letting us take over the campus for a few days As some of you know John is stepping down after 16 years as president of Stanford Fortunately for me I cannot do that to just stick around longer than my term limit John I m sure there are some people who want you to stick around longer but I m confident that you re going to do extraordinary things And we could not be prouder of John Hennessey and Stanford and all the great work that they have done So please give him a big round of applause Applause Now it s summer break Just so you all of you know Stanford is not always this quiet This school is unique Folks ride on bicycles everywhere Laughter And athletes are also computer engineers This is the place that made nerd cool Applause So we are thrilled to be here I know that I am not the first speaker that you ve heard from But many of you have traveled here from a long ways We ve got more than 170 countries from every region of the world represented Some of you this is the first time you are visiting our country So let me just say on behalf of the American people not only welcome to our Global Entrepreneurship Summit but welcome to the United States of America We are glad to have you Applause I am not going to give a long speech because what I really want to do is have a conversation with some outstanding young people who are part of our panel and we re going to introduce in a moment But I do want to begin by offering some opening thoughts about the time in which we gather here today And I m going to start with the British people s decision to leave the European Union the vote that took place yesterday Just a few hours ago I spoke with Prime Minister David Cameron David has been an outstanding friend and partner on the global stage And based on our conversation I m confident that the UK is committed to an orderly transition out of the EU We agreed that our economic and financial teams will remain in close contact as we stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability I then spoke to Chancellor Merkel of Germany and we agreed that the United States and our European allies will work closely together in the weeks and months ahead I do think that yesterday s vote speaks to the ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization But while the UK s relationship with the EU will change one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations That will endure The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners Our NATO alliance will remain a cornerstone of global security And in a few weeks we ll be meeting in Warsaw for the NATO Summit And our shared values including our commitment to democracy and pluralism and opportunity for all people in a globalized world that will continue to unite all of us And that is the work that brings us here today The world has shrunk It is interconnected All of you represent that interconnection Many of you are catalyzing it and accelerating it It promises to bring extraordinary benefits But it also has challenges And it also evokes concerns and fears And so part of why this Global Entrepreneurship Summit has been so close to my heart something that I ve been so committed to because I believe all of you represent all the upside of an interconnected world all the optimism and the hope and the opportunity that that interconnected world represents But it s also important in these discussions to find ways in which we are expanding and broadening the benefits of that interconnection to more and more people And that s what s so many of you are doing We re gathered here at Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley which is one of the great hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship not just for America but for the world This is a place that celebrates our ability as human beings to discover and learn and to build to question to reimagine to create new ways to connect and work with each other It s where two guys in a garage Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard launched a global company Where student projects became Yahoo and Google those were really good student projects Laughter My student projects weren t as good Laughter It s where entrepreneurs like so many of you get an idea and you build a team and you work to turn it into reality and you launch products and companies and entire industries that transform the world That s the power of entrepreneurship And it s never been more important In today s world where our economies have undergone dramatic shifts where business don t stop at borders where technology and automation have transformed virtually every industry and changed how people organize and work entrepreneurship remains the engine of growth That ability to turn an idea into reality a new venture a small business that creates good paying jobs that puts rising economies on the path to prosperity and empowers people to come together and tackle our most pressing global problems from climate change to poverty When people can start their own businesses it helps individuals and families succeed It can make whole communities more prosperous and more secure It offers a positive path for young people seeking the chance to make something of themselves and can empower people who have previously been locked out of the existing social order women and minorities others who aren t part of the old boys network give them a chance to contribute and to lead And it can create a culture where innovation and creativity are valued where we don t just look at the way things have always been but rather we say how could things be Why not Let s make something new This spirit speaks to something deep inside of all of us no matter who we are what we look like where we come from You look out across this auditorium you re all of different backgrounds and cultures and races and religions Some of you are from teeming cities others are working I small rural villages But you have that same spark that same creative energy to come up with innovative solutions to old challenges And entrepreneurship is what gives people like you a chance to fulfill your own dreams and create something bigger than yourselves We live in a time when more than half the world is under the age of 30 That means we got to make sure that all of our young people around the world have the tools they need to start new ventures and to create the jobs of the 21st century and to help lift up entire populations And so many of you are already doing this As I travel around the world one of the extraordinary things that I have the opportunity to do is to meet young people in every region and to see the problem solving and the energy and optimism that they re bringing to everything from how to generate electricity in environmentally sound ways in remote places that are off the grid right now to how do you employ women in remote areas who all too often have been locked out of opportunity You just see enormous creativity waiting to be tapped And part of our job part of this summit s job is to make sure that we re putting more tools more resources into the hands of these folks who are changing the world and making sure that all of you know each other so you can share best practices and ideas and spread the word Now I know the daily reality is not always as romantic as all this It turns out that starting your own business is not easy You have to have access to capital You have to meet the right people You have to have mentors who can guide you as you get your idea off the ground And that can be especially difficult for women and young people and minorities and others who haven t always had access to the same networks and opportunities You deserve the same chance to succeed as everybody else We ve got to make sure that everybody has a fair shot to reach their potential we can t leave more than half the team on the bench That s why we ve invested so much time and effort to make sure that America is helping to empower entrepreneurs like you We held our first summit back in 2010 Since then we ve brought entrepreneurs like you together in Turkey and the Emirates and Malaysia Morocco Kenya And all told we ve helped more than 17 000 entrepreneurs and innovators connect with each other access capital find mentors and start new ventures 17 000 Applause I think of the Tanzanian startup that helps farmers reduce their harvest losses Or the company in Nepal that s helping to improve charity health care There are 11 Cubans who are here today the first Cubans to join us at one of these summits Applause Hola Mucho gusto Applause They re ready to help create new opportunities for the Cuban people Where are they Applause There they are I want to thank Antonio Gracias a leader in private equity and one of our Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship because his support was critical in bringing these young Cuban entrepreneurs here So that s deserving of a hand Applause I m also pleased to announce that we have a new group of business leaders signing on as entrepreneurship ambassadors This is something that we started as part of the summit and they have put their time energy effort and in some cases their money behind entrepreneurs around the world So of our new ambassadors Sara Blakely CEO of Spanx Applause Jane Wurwand CEO of Dermalogica Applause Steven Jurvetson partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson Applause And Patrick Collison CEO of Stripe Applause Now supporting entrepreneurs isn t just something we do around the world It s also a key part of how we create jobs and fuel innovation here in the United States And it s why we re working with communities to streamline the process for launching a company Startup in a Day It s why we re expanding Innovation Corps our program to equip more scientists and engineers with entrepreneurial skills And it s why at this summit dozens of top tech companies from giants to startups are committing to make their technology workforces look like America including by publishing data on diversity each year and developing the tech talent of people from all backgrounds We re very happy for the commitments that they ve made so give them a big round of applause for that Applause Here at this summit we re also building on our progress with new commitments from government and businesses and philanthropists So at last year s Paris climate talks for example Bill Gates and other top global investors committed to partnering with governments to invest in cutting edge clean energy solutions Today we re launching an initiative to connect some of these global investors and others with clean energy entrepreneurs from developing countries We re also announcing the Young Transatlantic Innovation Leaders Initiative which will bring 200 of Europe s innovators to the U S each year to develop their skills Applause And we ve got organizations like Endeavor which supports entrepreneurs starting a 100 million fund to invest in companies across Latin America and the Middle East in Africa and Southeast Asia Applause Investment firms like Capria Ventures which will help fund international startups So these are just a handful of the commitments and I suspect new ventures that are going to come out of this year s summit So all of you budding entrepreneurs don t be shy while you re here Talk to the experts here Make your pitch Network with potential investors Find that mentor who might help you navigate through a tough patch Connect with your fellow innovators Because ultimately the world needs your creativity and your energy and your vision You are going to be what helps this process of global integration work in a way that is good for everyone and not just some Now I ve spoken about this before I believe we are better off in a world in which we are trading and networking and communicating and sharing ideas But that also means that cultures are colliding and sometimes is disruptive and people get worried You re the bridge you re the glue particularly the young people who are here who can help lead towards a more peaceful and more prosperous future that provides opportunity for everybody And because this is about more than just this one event or for that matter this one President we re going to make sure that the United States continues to help developing the next generation of entrepreneurs We are very proud to announce that next year s Global Entrepreneurship Summit will be hosted in India Applause Got the Indian contingent in the house I ll try to stop by if I m invited Laughter But the point is I believe in you and America believes in you And we believe that you have the talent and the skills and the ambition not just to pursue your dreams but to realize them that you can lift up not just your own families but communities and countries and create opportunity and prosperity and hope for decades to come That s the promise that we see in all of you And that is the promise that we see in our outstanding panelists that you re going to hear from Mai Medhat of Egypt who is a software engineer who started a company called Eventtus which is a one stop online shop for people who organize events Applause We see it in Jean Bosco Nzeyimana of Rwanda who is the founder and CEO of Habona Limited a company that uses biomass and waste to develop eco friendly fuels that are used in rural Africa Applause Mariana Costa Checa of Peru Mariana is the founder of Laboratoria which gives young women from low income backgrounds the education and tools they need to work in the digital sector Applause And if that lineup is not enough you also see it in a guy that you may have heard of who has done pretty well for himself the founder and CEO of Facebook  Applause They re the real experts Let s welcome them to the stage and we ll start having a conversation with them Thank you Applause This is a good looking group And I could not wear a T shirt like Mark laughter for at least another six months but I will take off my jacket so that I don t look too formal Applause   Soon  Barack Obama Soon It s going to happen soon So yes sit down everybody Relax Laughter So these are some extraordinary entrepreneurs Some are just getting started some seem to be moving along pretty well But I thought this was wonderfully representative because it s from different regions of the world it s companies that are at different stages And maybe we can just start by having everybody introduce themselves describe a little bit about what they re doing And then we can sort of have a discussion about what s been easy what s been hard how can government policy like the U S government policy help in advancing some of these issues How can other countries governments because we have 20 representatives from other governments participating in this summit how should they think about encouraging entrepreneurship And then most importantly how can other businesses and venture capital et cetera think about some of these international opportunitiesSo Mai why don t we start with you And tell us I was hearing some of the great work you re doing Tell us more about it  Medhat Thank you It s so great to be here Laughter and applause I m software engineer I have an engineering background One day I heard that the first Startup Weekend is happening in Cairo And I was not invited but I went anyway with my friend I went with my friend She was invited and she turned out to be my co founder And we were there just to learn about startups meet mentors and other entrepreneurs And it was very hard to network and meet people during the event We felt like there was a gap between the organizers and attendees And then a week after we attended inaudible Cairo and we had the same experience We felt there should be a better way for organizers to organize events and for the attendees to experience events Everyone is there for networking connecting people and sharing experience So we did our research and we were very passionate about the idea We felt like we can do something in the event space So we quit our jobs and we started working on this full time before even having the Eventtus And now we have a full engagement and networking platform for events It s a very interactive app with 86 percent engagement in most of our events So we are helping people getting together during events And now we have a great team two offices in Cairo and Dubai And we are working with most of events in our region When I look back on the journey it wasn t easy at all It was very challenging It was very exciting as well But it was full of ups and downs And we started before even the first accelerator in Egypt was started We had few mentors back then But now we have a number of amazing startups a number of mentors and support organizations who are working together So I can see the ecosystem has grown very well but we still have a lot to do  Barack Obama That s great Thank you Applause Jean Bosco  Nzeyimana Thank you It s an honor to be here So when I was growing up in the rural villages in Rwanda I used to spend countless hours in the forest collecting firewood for my parents and fetching water And that was not just me but dozens of other children in Africa are facing the same challenges They are involved in laborious activities to help their parents just to have a meal instead of going to school So as I was growing up I kept thinking about something that I can do to help these families have access to other alternative fuels that they can use to replace charcoal that they have been using for many years So I came up with an idea of a inaudible approach whereby we collect inaudible and then we turn them into affordable and environmentally friendly products in form of briquettes and biogas that people can then use And that is like a green cooking fuel which can improve health and sanitation in homes As we started it has been two years and I have employed more than 25 people giving them permanent jobs And we are trying to expand to other areas of the country so that we can continue to improve sanitation as well as providing these kind of alternative fuels which can improve health and mitigate climate change in the country and Africa in general Applause  Barack Obama Excellent Mariana  Costa Checa It s an honor to be here I m still trying to get over the fact that you just introduced me Laughter I m so happy So I did Laboratoria We are a social enterprise And I started it in Peru two years ago We are now in Peru and Chile and Mexico And what we tried to do is to go out and find talent where nobody else is looking for it So we tried to identify young women who haven t been able to access quality education or job opportunities because of economic limitations and train them to become the most awesome developers they can be and connect them with employment opportunities in the tech sector Something that I realize is that when our students join our program most of them are completely unaware of their potential and they come thinking that it s going to be really hard to break this vicious cycle of low skill employment underpaid employment or just domestic work But they soon start learning to code and it s just such a powerful skill set A few weeks into the program they start building their first websites their first apps their games and showing them to the world And it s so empowering And six months after joining they re ready to go out and join the workforce So we have students who get three job offers from the coolest companies in town They go out they get to decide where they want to go and work They triple their income so they significantly improve their economic circumstances They start supporting their families And I think most importantly they start realizing that anything is possible if they work hard enough for it no And we have students that have gone from working at a corner shop in a slum to working at the IDB in Washington as developers a few blocks from the White House So really they are an example that anything is possible no And they re changing not only their lives but they re changing their communities their cities And I think they are transforming the tech sector in Latin America They are bringing the diversity and the talent that the sector needs to really become a leading force in our economy And I m pretty sure that as we continue to grow and reach thousands of women in the region they are going to change our countries for the better and making sure that we can actually base our growth on the most important thing that we have and that s our young talent  Barack Obama That s great Applause Now when we were talking backstage I had been reading about this and I said 60 percent of the women who have gone through this program now were employed And I was corrected it s now 70 percent I had old data Laughter But I think it s important to point out your success rate has been quite extraordinary already So it s wonderful  Costa Checa Thank you  Barack Obama Mark there was a time when you were sort of in their shoes But now obviously Facebook s success has been extraordinary But I m sure that you still can connect with the stories that are told here and some of the stories out there How is Facebook thinking about its own role in creating this platform for entrepreneurship around the world I know that s something that you ve been thinking a lot about   Well it s really inspiring to be here with so many great entrepreneurs and to hear about all the work that you re doing and it s an honor So thanks for having me To me entrepreneurship is about creating change not just creating companies And the most effective entrepreneurs who I ve met care deeply about some mission and some change that they re trying to create And often they don t even start because they re trying to create a company And that s how I think about my connection to all of us here is when I was getting started I cared deeply about giving everyone a voice and giving the people the tools to share everything that they cared about and bringing a community together And it started small in one university And I didn t think it was going to be company at the time As a matter of fact I was pretty convinced that at some point someone would build something like this for the world but I thought that that would be some other company that already had thousands of engineers and was used to building stuff for hundreds of millions of people around the world And what ended up happening was that no one built it so we just kind of kept on going Laughter People said at each step along the way what you re doing all right maybe college students like it but no one else is going to like it and there s not going to be any money in doing this So you only really do it if you care if you re passionate about doing it And then it started growing and people said it would be fad and it would never be a good business But you keep going because you care not because you re trying to create a business And then there s the shift to mobile where people thought that it wouldn t be a sustainable business And through each of these things the entrepreneurs who I think build things that last for a long time keep going because they care fundamentally about the change that they re trying to create in the world And they re not in it just to build a company And I carry that with me today So today we live in a world with more than 7 billion people but more than 4 billion of us are not on the Internet And we talk about having an equal opportunity to be able to create a change in the world and I think that s a really hard thing to do if you don t have access to some of the basic infrastructure and technical tools that are necessary to build these kinds of technical products So I kind of think about what we re doing today very similarly to how I thought about where we were at the beginning I get people all the time who come to me and say all right well you re investing billions of dollars in trying to put Internet connectivity in places where we don t get paid for it It s not something that we ll make any money from for a very long period of time if it works out But it s this deep belief that you re trying to make a change You re trying to connect people in the world And I really do believe that if you do something good and if you help people out then eventually some portion of that good will come back to you And you may not know upfront what it s going to be but that s just been the guiding principle for me in the work that we ve done And I hope that some of the work that we do can play a role in empowering you and so many more entrepreneurs to build the next great companies Applause  Barack Obama Excellent So for the three budding entrepreneurs you ve already had some success and positive feedback But I know that this is still hard sometimes and frustrating And let s go back to the earlier question that I asked What do you find to be some of the biggest hurdles for your success And are there policies that either your governments could be pursuing or that the United States in conjunction with your governments could be pursuing that would really make this process if not easy then at least a little bit smoother And are there questions or concerns that you have in terms of how more established businesses like Facebook how they might be able to interact with startups like yours So we ll go in reverse order this time Why don t we start with you  Costa Chica Yes so I think there s been many challenges along the way In our case we try to disrupt many preconceptions I think So at the beginning many people were like how are you going to train people in months and get them a job How are you going to get young women who went to a public high school that s not very good to actually become competitive in the labor market And I think luckily we ve overcome those and we ve proved that they are incredibly talented that you can learn in months instead of years And most of the companies that hire our developers actually rehire So they realize that they re great and they re as competitive as anyone else who comes from a different background So I think that s been very very encouraging on our way And the little secret that I have I think being a social entrepreneur is that motivation is everything you know And when there are bad times and where we are not making the end of the month to pay all our people and when we re facing all these challenges I usually just go into a classroom Like let me go into a classroom myself to the girls who study with us And they are the main force behind not only myself but all my team my partners and all my team because they are fighting so hard to making it happen They are traveling sometimes commuting four hours a day to come and go back They have on top of their studies a lot of domestic responsibilities and they re proving that it can be done So that s always a reality check to say you know I have everything I need to keep going at this Applause  Barack Obama Good Jean Bosco  Nzeyimana Great I think one of the most biggest challenges that I have faced was because I started this company very young At that time I was 19 years old and in my culture it is believed that those great initiatives are started by old people and those things which have been difficult for other people cannot be possible for young people So I try to disrupt that status quo and I created this company Because during that period no one was even trusting me so that they can be my employee so I had to be my own marketer I had to be the technical boss I had to be everything in the company so that I can build that kind of first impression so that I can impress a few people to come to me and help me run this cause And the other challenge that we were facing is that a lot of financial institutions didn t even know what we were talking about because these are the kind of renewable energy that we wanted to bring to Rwanda And you would find a lot of folks working in banks asking you what are you trying to do Because they don t even understand what you are doing It was like very difficult for them to analyze and calculate the risk that might be involved in the activities that we re trying to do But because I trusted in my solution and this kind of thing that I wanted to do to my community I kept pushing applying for different competitions And luckily I won the United States Africa Development Foundation grant to start this initiative And when I started people started to see how you can take advantage in ways that you already have to produce some products which can then go back in communities and be solutions which can improve lives of many people And then from there people started coming But the lesson that I learned from that very basic experience is that no matter what you are trying to do it is necessary is that you are having the kind of motive in your mind that you want to help your society move forward So the policies and the other partners take hold as we come along the way to help you run the initiative But that will happen once you start If you don t start no one will come and join you Applause  Barack Obama Good So we ve heard well that s interesting and part of what the two of you have described is first of all each country has its own culture and there are going to be sometimes some cultural barriers whether it s attitudes about women and what they can do whether it s attitudes about young people and how seriously they take a young person Mark had to deal with that a little bit But here obviously in the United States and particularly in Silicon Valley I think that s begun to change But there s also just basic issues like financing and having access to capital particularly when it s a new idea and it doesn t fit the existing models that the banks or other financial institutions may have Mai do those kinds of challenges resonate in your experience And how did you navigate through those  Medhat Yes I think all the entrepreneurs like everywhere in the world we share the same challenges I think I did almost every single mistake that you read about in every startup related book Laughter I learned everything the hard way So yes it s a learning process Funding was one of the challenges of course The other one was the legal system and the legal structure especially in Egypt It s not startup friendly So you have to do all of the work arounds and you have to be persistent to get over that building a team as well like I m a woman And I started I was young  Barack Obama You re still young I think  Medhat Yes Laughter  Barack Obama I think you qualify as young  Medhat So yes I had almost the same challenges I d say that the only thing that keeps us going is believing in our idea believing that we can do something we can add value to people s life And this is the only thing that keeps me wake every day in the morning and go to work  Barack Obama Well all of you are expressing what Mark said which is it starts with a passion If you start off just saying I want to make money but there s no clear mission behind it then when you start hitting some of these barriers sometimes it s very hard to push through them With respect to some of the barriers that you re talking about the U S in connection to the Entrepreneurship Summit what we ve been trying to do is take best practices and learn lessons about what s working and what s not And so in the grants that we re providing or the training that we re providing what these summits have been really useful in doing is hearing directly from entrepreneurs and say this program doesn t work as well as it could this one works really well What we re also trying to do though is encourage governments to listen and hear from entrepreneurs to build a different kind of culture So the point you made Mai about how hard is it to get a business started how much paperwork do you have to fill out What kinds of fees do you have to pay How much bureaucracy do you have to sort through That s something that here in the United States we ve had to deal with ourselves And what we ve tried to do is to both simplify processes but also use technology in ways that means you don t have to travel across town in Cairo to go to an office and the person you need to see isn t there and then you have to travel back and reschedule the next day And the traffic is terrible and it s driving you crazy If you can go on the net and do a lot of that work ahead of time that can make a huge difference in accelerating the process that you re doing And so I m very glad that we have 20 countries represented here because part of what we re doing is getting commitments from those other countries to say we re going to learn from each other and figure how we can streamline these efforts so that we re making life a little bit easier for young people like you  Medhat Yes actually when we started we didn t know where to start from Like we couldn t find any information online for example on how to get the company registered in Egypt We didn t know any startup lawyers or anyone who can register the company for us So we had to go ourselves and ask for help from other people  Barack Obama Right  Medhat And we couldn t find any information It took us so much time effort and money  Barack Obama Well even here in the United States where it s much easier to do business we still have 16 agencies that are in charge of doing business We ve tried to streamline them into one It requires congressional action Laughter and applause So at least what we ve tried to do is consolidate the websites so that it s easier to get the information even though you still have to deal potentially with 16 different agencies for different needs So there are specific things that the government can do to be more entrepreneur friendly How can companies like Facebook or Google or some of the venture funds that are represented here how should they think about finding good ideas What sorts of mentorship or training would you find most helpful Obviously having experienced entrepreneurs or people who have seen startups in the past maybe can help you avoid a few of the lessons And part of the goal of the summit here is to build these networks so that that kind of mentorship is available But Mark I know that Facebook is already doing some of these issues Tell us about some of the things that you re excited about And then maybe we hear from them about other working opportunities that they ve been looking for   Sure Well we have a developer program all over the world where we go around and it s called FbStart And we give entrepreneurs free access to tools and some of them a lot of the tools that people can use are free from Facebook and other places But in order to help get started with businesses we give to different companies tens of thousands of dollars worth of Facebook tools to get started But it s also important to help people learn how to use the tools so we do these entrepreneurship workshops around the world for those people who are starting to create technical companies but also for small businesses which are I think an important part maybe less the focus of this summit but that s a huge part of what we try to do around the world and help people get on the Internet and connect with people that they re trying to sell their products to And we have more than 50 million small business pages that are on Facebook and a large number of them use it as their primary presence for communicating with people and attracting new customers So that s a pretty good basic tool that s out there The biggest thing that I m personally focused on is connectivity though I mean I think for you guys and we talked about this a little bit backstage I think you re mostly in places that have reasonable connectivity I mean you were talking about how sometimes when you go home it s not so good but in general I think for a whole other big population wave of folks this really is a blocking factor If you grew up and you never used a computer or you ve never had access to the Internet it s often hard to even imagine what you re missing out on And this is a local problem but I think we need to do a better job of empowering folks in different countries to be able to spread connectivity This isn t something that the U S or some American company can come in and do In the places where it s worked it s been in partnership with local companies and local entrepreneurs and local governments And that s also something that I d love you guys advice on how you think we could be doing a better job of spreading connectivity to enable not just you guys but other entrepreneurs who haven t even had the opportunities that you ve had to build things as well  Barack Obama Tell us what s happening in terms of productivity and how does that connect with creating the supply for these wonderful young women that you re training Obviously things are growing but speak to Mark s point about how you see things unfolding both in Peru and Latin America over these several years  Costa Checa We ll first of all Facebook is such an amazing tool for us because we are finding women who have had limited access to the digital world as a whole but no matter where you go Facebook is there I think young people today view their digital lives through Facebook So everything about our program even though we don t have email and they have a limited use of the Internet they have a Facebook account  Barack Obama And Mark is very happy to hear this Laughter  Costa Checa Yes It is a great connection because it s a starting point you know And we usually find at our events where we do a inaudible about our program and encourage young women to apply we talk a lot about Facebook because this is a way out and we know what s behind it And that s I see as a very important thread in our communication So thank you It helps a lot And in terms of connectivity I think Latin America is moving forward but there are still many important challenges And as we were discussing before there are very few companies in the market and we bring some challenges And we also have many many Latin Americans are very centralized in the capital city or in the major cities where usually connectivity is not a problem But as you get further away it becomes a challenge So I think it should definitely be a priority for our government In the case of Peru I think the government is realizing that this is important And I have to say that we ve been really lucky we ve had support from the government because they realize that they not only need to expand access to digital services but they also need to start bringing in more people to create digital products We have a talent gap and if we want to evolve and have more digital services who s going to build them So that s been really lucky on our side And just one final point I think it s crucial for interpreters to work hand in hand with big companies and with government I think that we entrepreneurs have the amazing advantage of being able to take huge sometimes irresponsible risks We can just go out and try new things all the time And this is something that as you become larger and if you re a government it s way harder no So I think we have a role to play there in building new things in creating new things And I think when it comes to scaling up those things these partnerships are essential to enable us to take what we build and created and tested and tried to a larger scale  Barack Obama I think that s a great point So for example the kind of training you re doing even with our entire education infrastructure here we still have that same gap We initiated something through our administration called TechHire where we re going into communities and cities where people can t imagine that they could somehow be part of the tech industry And what we re finding is is that through months of training in some cases through a community college in some cases companies who are joining with us it turns out that you can train people very effectively And as we prove concept now we have the opportunity to scale up throughout the job training programs that already exist in the U S government So I think you re making a terrific point that in the same way that your individual companies are taking risks proving concept and then trying to scale up in the private sector part of what governments need to be doing is when they see something that is working a tool an app a mechanism that saves time makes something more convenient makes a product more accessible to people then we have to be prepared to change how we do business and potentially scale up as well So you re right that it s hard sometimes for governments to take massive risks but what governments can do is to partner with entrepreneurs start small work out the kinks and then be able to back the process of scaling up in that way Jean Bosco any additional thoughts in terms of how not only Mark but all the VCs out here can help you out Laughter Make your pitch man Applause Tell them how they can pull out their checkbook and  Nzeyimana I think Facebook is doing a great job in terms of improving connectivities And when you look at the situation in my country we are really trying but we still have a long way to go because connectivity is only available in cities And although you can find it in villages but it s not really fast so that you can t use it on some activities like watching videos or sending heavy files to other people So we are still having a challenge in terms of connectivity and rapid Internet But what we re trying to do as small businesses is looking at the tools that big companies like Facebook offers so that you can benefit from them like using messengers to exchange messages with potential customers And you know we use inaudible to see how we can disseminate messages Because in my country a lot of people don t know this kind of waste management teams that want to bring and you see that in many places people don t sort waste for themselves they just throw waste everywhere But we are using this kind of technology to teach people that they have to sort waste from organic to non organic because this is beneficial in this way and this is harmful in this way So we are trying to use these kinds of tools to disseminate such image And the challenge that we are still facing is the fact that when are still small of course you are like so that you can attract attention from many people to come and join But depending on these kind of spotlight exposure support that you are getting from different people we are trying to benefit from these kind of initiatives to send the messages and bring attention of many people to what we re doing Q Good Mai  Medhat Yes I don t know where to start exactly In Egypt Facebook we started a revolution out of Facebook Applause Facebook was the only way we communicated during the revolution And after that I believe you have the numbers but Facebook Basics has grown tremendously since then And it s a basic tool now Like now everyone in Egypt they have Facebook And we were just talking about the Facebook Basics And it was blocked in Egypt so I think there is a lot to do And also back to the connectivity thing I m praying now I m not sure if my team and my family are watching this or not because they can t livestream Laughter I hope they are not seeing the  Barack Obama The buffering  Medhat  the loading Laughter  Barack Obama That s so irritating I know Laughter and applause I hear you If it makes you feel any better it happens to me too Laughter I thought I d have the best gear but I m just sitting there waiting waiting Laughter  Medhat Yes it affects the business as well Now I moved to Dubai and I have to manage the team in Cairo And it s very hard to communicate it s very hard to do a Skype call with the team or something like that So we have to work around it We have to pay a lot of money Actually I have been trying to get another line in the office for like four months now and we still didn t get another line  Barack Obama That s in Dubai  Medhat That s in Egypt in Cairo No Dubai is  Barack Obama Is better  Medhat It s even yes it s much better Laughter Yes they re doing a good job in Dubai yes  Barack Obama I mean some of this is you raise a couple important points First of all the huge opportunity here is for countries to leapfrog existing infrastructure And obviously we see this in Africa in India places where mobile banking and payment systems have accelerated even more rapidly than they have here farmers using information to access prices to markets so that they re selling their goods at a decent price So there is an infrastructure and connectivity function that governments can play You re raising another question an issue though which is a sensitive topic in some countries which is openness It is hard to foster and encourage an entrepreneurial culture if it s closed and if information flows are blocked And what we are seeing around the world oftentimes is governments wanting the benefits of entrepreneurship and connectivity but thinking that top down control is also compatible with that And it s not People remark on my 2008 campaign and how we were really early adapters of so much technology It wasn t because I knew what I was doing It s because a bunch of 20 year olds came to me and said hey there s this new thing called Myspace Laughter   Ouch Laughter  Barack Obama That was just a little dig Laughter But the point is that they had all this stuff that I had never heard of And if I had tried to maintain control and said no no no we re going with pamphlets because I m used to pamphlets and I can control what s in the pamphlet then I might not be sitting here Well the same is true for governments as a whole There is a cultural shift that is sometimes difficult that says we are empowering individuals And we are open to ideas We are willing to admit new information that maybe contradicts our old preconceptions We re willing to test those new ideas And if they don t work we re going to try something else That s the connection between connectivity and the Internet and science And part of what has created all this part of what Stanford is all about is our capacity to say we don t know to say that all the received wisdom might not be right And we re willing to test it And that is threatening sometimes It s threatening to governments It s threatening to cultures But that is the essence of discovery and innovation And so one of the things that we ve been trying to do and just encourage through the State Department is to gently and sometimes bluntly talk to governments about their need to maintain an openness and a confidence in their own people What makes it harder admittedly is the fact that the openness and the power of connectivity also can empower some bad people So us wrestling with how do we counter the sort of violent extremism that can end up poisoning the mind and resulting in what we saw happening in Orlando that s a constant balance that we re trying to weigh But what I worry about is people using that as an excuse then to try to block things off and control the flow of information And that s a question that I think young people are attuned to and they re going to have to pay attention to and all of us are going to have to fight for in the years to come Well this has been an extraordinary conversation How are we doing on time We re all done But I m having so much fun Laughter Give our panelists a big round of applause Congratulations for the great work you re doing Applause Thank you everybody Applause '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2016-022', 'content': ' Interviewer Welcome to How to Build the Future Today our guest is  Uh Mark you have built one of the most influential companies in the history of the world so we are especially excited that you are here    laugh I m not sure where to go from there  Interviewer  laugh Um why don t we start with just the early days of Facebook Um tell us what it was like when you started it   Sure So for me the thing that I was really fascinated by and always have been is um people right and and how how people work Um you know when I was in college I I studied psychology and computer science and you know one of the things that you learn when you study psychology is that there are all these parts of the brain which are geared just towards understanding people Right Understanding language how how to communicate with each other um understanding facial expressions emotions processing Um yet when I looked out at the Internet right in in 2004 which is when I was getting started you can find almost anything else that you wanted Right You could find news uh movies music uh reference materials But the thing that mattered the most to people um which was other people and like understanding what s going on with them it just wasn t there right And I I think what was going on was that all that other content was just out there able to be indexed by you know search engines and and other services but in in order to understand what s going on with people you needed to build uh tools that made it so that they could express what was going on with themselves You know I wanted to figure out what courses to take so I I built this little website Coursematch that I you know that just made it so that you could enter what courses you were taking and you could click on them and see who else was in them and it did all these correlations It told you people who who who took this course were likely to enjoy this course too And you know the thing that just struck me from the beginning is you know people would just spend hours clicking through Here are the courses that people are taking and wow it like isn t it interesting that this person is interested in these things and I mean it was just text Right There was nothing that was like super interesting there But that just struck me as you know people have this deep thirst to understand what s going on with with those around them and um you know there were probably you know ten other things like that that I built when I was at Harvard before I actually got around to to building the first version of of Facebook that kind of added a lot of these things together  Interviewer Did you think Facebook was going to be a company when you started   I I built the first version of Facebook because it s something that my friends and I wanted to use uh at Harvard A a directory and a way to connect with the other people around us I I didn t think at all that it was going to be a company I I remember very specifically the night that that we launched um the first version I I went out to to get pizza with um a couple of my friends who um who who now work here and you know and I I remember really clearly how we were talking about one day we thought that someone was going to build a community like this for the world and that that would be some company but it clearly wasn t going to be us I mean it it it s just it wasn t even  Interviewer It didn t even occur   Yeah no I mean it it wasn t even an option that we considered that it might be us I mean we we just weren t focused on building a company back then We were just building something that that we thought would be useful at our school  Interviewer So a a as you look back is there something that made Facebook different from the other projects that you had built that allowed it to turn into this the company it is today   Um well for one I think we we kept going Right So I mean the the others I mean Coursematch and um you know and just the the other different crowdsource tools Um you know they they kind of served their purpose  Interviewer Yeah   And then then we were done whereas with Facebook there was just such you know people loved it right and and had such an intensity of using it I think within a couple of weeks uh two thirds of students at Harvard were using it and all these other students at MIT and other local uh universities were writing in asking us if we could open up uh Facebook at their school So we kind of just followed that right And you know again I I didn t set out and you know my roommates didn t set out to to build a service that we were going to turn into a company but we just kind of followed what people wanted and that led us to expand it to all these other schools and um and eventually beyond schools and to you know at some point uh once we d hired a bunch of people we decided to turn it into a company and and and um and go for this mission of connecting the world But that s not where we started  Interviewer As you think about where you did start is there other advice that comes to mind that you give to other people that want to build products uh that you can take away from the early days of Facebook   Yeah You know I always think that you should start with the problem that you re trying to solve in the world and not start with um deciding that you want to build a company Right  Interviewer Yeah   I mean the best companies that that get built are are things that are trying to drive some kind of social change even if it s just local in one place Uh you know more than starting out because you want to make a bunch of money or or have a lot of people working for you or or build some company in some way So you know I always think that this is kind of a perverse thing about Silicon Valley in a way  Interviewer That s really true   Which is that you know people decide often that they want to start a company before they even decide what they want to do And that just feels really backwards to me and you know for anyone who s had the experience of actually building a company you know that you go through some really hard things along the way and I think part of what gets you through that is believing in what you re doing and knowing that what you re doing is is really delivering a lot of value for people Um and that s I think how the best companies end up getting made  Interviewer Uh I want to talk for a second about low points because I think people never appreciate how bad they really are and I think it s always reassuring to hear that even  went through some serious low points and came out okay So can you tell us about some of the hardest parts in the history of the early history of Facebook   Yeah I think one of the hardest parts for me was um was actually when Yahoo offered to buy the company for for a lot of money Because up until that point that was the turning point in the company where before that we uh every day we d just come in and kind of do what we thought was the right next thing to do right We d open two more schools We we opened a high school and opened Beyond Schools and um you know launched more photos That that s what it seemed like the next thing that we needed to do to help people express themselves and and understand more of what was going on around them Um but then you know Yahoo came in with this um with this really meaningful offer right Uh uh a billion dollars for um  Interviewer And this was how far into the company  It was a couple of years in  Interviewer Okay   Right and you know we had ten million people using the product at the time right so it wasn t like it wasn t as if it were obvious that we were going to succeed far beyond that And that was the first point where we really had to um to look at the future and say wow is what we re going to build um going to actually um be so much more meaningful for this And you know that caused a lot of interesting conversations in the company and and with our investors and you know at the end of that Dustin and I just decided you know no we think that we can actually go connect more than just the ten million people who are in schools We can go beyond that and and have this really be a successful thing and we just had to go for it That was really stressful because a lot of people really thought that we should sell the company and um and you know for a lot of folks who joined a startup I I feel like at that point I hadn t been very good about communicating that we were trying to go for this mission  Interviewer Yeah   Um you know we just showed up every day and just kind of did what we thought was the right next thing to do So for a lot of the folks who joined early on they they weren t really aligned with me right For for them you know they joined and um you know being able to sell a company for a billion dollars after a couple of years that was like a home run right And and it is a home run right And and that s you know I think that that s um I I get that but you know that I think that the fact that I didn t communicate very well about what we were trying to do caused um caused this huge tension And the point that was painful wasn t wasn t turning down the offer It was the fact that after that um huge amounts of the company quit because they didn t believe in in what we were what we were doing Right I mean if you look at the management team that we had  Interviewer Did that whole management team leave   The whole management team was gone within um within about a year after that  Interviewer Did you ever regret that decision in that period Like were there times where you were like Well we should ve sold   Um you know we were I was I got really lucky because you know not only did did what I believed in end up working out but it ended up working out pretty quickly right So it literally you know I think this was in the summer of 2006 and by um I think the next month after that we launched New Feed which now ten years later looking back at it is you know one of the most used products in the world And then we launched the ability for anybody to sign up which immediately um started um growing the community So within a few months after turning down the offer I think it was actually pretty clear that that it was the right decision But you know I think you know since then there have been much harder decisions  Interviewer Yeah   That we ve had to make where you know sometimes you have to you have to bet on something and and you know either you know bet the direction of the company or you know bet billions of dollars on something and it s not going to be clear whether you re right for five or ten years That I think actually can end up being much harder than this one  Interviewer That s what I want to talk about next but before we go there have you ever thought about selling the company again since   No after that point  Interviewer So that was just   Yeah  Interviewer Got that out of the way We re going to hire people that want to be here for a long time and   Yeah  Interviewer Cool Um yeah so I want to talk about one of the most common questions we get from people building products is how to decide what to build   Mm hmm affirmative  Interviewer How to figure out when to bet the company How to do something totally new   Yeah  Interviewer And I think one thing that Facebook has done incredibly well is figure out what to build   Mm hmm affirmative  Interviewer And be and build this repeated innovation culture which I think is like the hardest thing to do in business So how have you done that and how do you advise other people to do the same   I think the key is building a company which is focused on learning as quickly as possible Right Companies are are learning organisms and you can make decisions that either make it so that you learn faster or you learn slower And you know in a lot of ways building a company is like following the scientific method Right You you try a bunch of different hypotheses and if you set up the experiments well then you kind of learned what to do And that that s an important philosophy so through all these different decisions that we make inside the company you know everything down to um really empowering individual engineers We invest in this huge um testing framework right At any given point in time there aren t there s not just one version of Facebook running in the world right There s probably tens of thousands of versions running because engineers here have the power to um to try out an idea and and ship it to you know maybe ten thousand people or a hundred thousand people And then they get a readout on how um that version of what they did whether it was um a a change to you know show better content in New Feed or or EY change or some new feature They they get a readout on how that version performed compared to the baseline version of of Facebook that we have on everything that we care about How how connected people are Um you know how much people are sharing and how much they say that they re finding meaningful content Um business metrics like how how much revenue we make and and engagement of the overall community And you know by running tens of thousands of different experiments and and putting the power in people s hands to try all these different things you can imagine we just make so much more progress than we could if every change had to be approved by me Or every idea had to come from management So I I do think that there s something very deep about building this you know learning culture and moving quickly towards that that just helps you get ahead over time  Interviewer What about the the bigger bets like making a large acquisition or the rollout of News Feed or something like that How how do those decisions work   So I actually think when you do stuff well you don t you you shouldn t have to do big crazy things Right So you want to actually evolved in in a way where you re working with your community and making steps and and learning So take New Feed for example That that was a relatively big shift but it actually had been a couple of years in the making by watching what how people were using the service right  Interviewer Right   So you know when we started off we we didn t have anything like News Feed that showed you updates from from what people were sharing We just had profiles and what we found were originally one of the big behaviors were people would just click around right to They d click on different profiles um hundreds of them just to And they d go through all their friends to see what people had changed right to see what the update was and um in in their friend s day And we learned from that that people were not just interested in looking up and and learning about a person but also understanding the day to day changes So you know first we made this product that uh just showed in in order which of your friends had updated their profile right So that at least told you whose profile to click on And then the first version of News Feed was really simple All it did was it basically took the content that people were posting and put it in order on um on on your homepage Um so I think when you re when things are working well you you use data and you use the qualitative feedback that you re getting from from listening to how your community is using your product to tell you what problems to go solve And then you basically use intuition to figure out what the solutions to those problems might be and then you test those hypotheses by by rolling them out and getting more data and feedback on that and then that gives you a sense of where to go Um you know when I look at things like you know we bought um you know the Oculus Team for a lot of money I actually view that as um you know if we d done a better job of building up some of the expertise to do some of that stuff internally then you know maybe we wouldn t have had to do that But instead we hadn t done that and you know the Oculus team is by far the most talented team working on that problem Um so it just made sense to go make this big move But I actually kind of think as CEO it s your job to not get into a position where you need to be doing these crazy things  Interviewer Right yes   You know of course it s it s inevitable You know over the period of doing stuff you ll um you know you can t be ahead of everything so it s better to um to make big moves and be willing to to do that than you know have pride and and not do that and never admit that you that you um could ve done something better in the past But but then when stuff is working well you re you re learning incrementally and and growing that way  Interviewer Speaking of growing um one thing I heard you say years ago is that one of the best things Facebook had done was invent the idea of a growth group   Mm hmm affirmative  Interviewer And so this is something now that I ve heard a lot of founders ask about Can you tell us um is that still something you recommend people running companies put in place and and how Facebook s worked in the early days   So making it so we could grow faster was I think the most important product feature that we uh ended up building for Facebook And you know the traditional approach to growing and marketing is you know you have a communications group or you have a marketing team and you buy ads and you know I think that there s sometimes there s a place for for that Um especially when you re trying to communicate something and and get a message out But if you re actually trying to um to grow a product I think the often the best levers for doing that are within the product themselves and getting people in your community who enjoy what you re doing uh to evangelize that to their friends and getting that to happen efficiently as efficiently as possible So you know there s no magic in the growth group that we um that we built that other people can t replicate You know it s just being very rigorous with data investing in data infrastructure so that way you can process all these different experiments and and learn what people are trying to tell you and um and then go invest engineering and actually um try and grow the community because I think that that s the most important feature for a lot of networks  Interviewer And can you tell how much of an impact that group had on the growth rate of Facebook   Um yeah I think it s You know there Overall I think it s been very big Um I I don t have a number off the top of my head but I mean even just looking at you know some of these specific features that we ve built like People You May Know right  Interviewer Yeah   Which is you know one of the important things right Again if your you know a social product isn t that useful if you re not connected to other people when you re using it So you know helping you go from signing up for Facebook to connecting to the people that you care about most is probably one of the most important things that we can do  Interviewer Uh another thing that I think Facebook has done exceptionally well is hiring and and I always tell founders that this is the thing that you have to get good at So how have you hired your team uh and and what do you look for when you bring people on   If you think about it you know I started the company when I was 19 right So I can t institutionally believe that experience is that important  Interviewer Right   Or else I would have a hard time reconciling you know myself right and and the company So you know we invest in in people who we think are just really talented even if they haven t done that thing before And you know that applies to people who are fresh out of university as well as you know people like um you know the CFO who took the company public had not taken a company public before right And a lot of his background was in um you know production uh development at Genentech before So just focus on really talented people  Interviewer And so if you don t have the experience to look for how do you assess someone s raw talent   Um well often you can tell from different things that they ve done right So it s it s not that You know obviously everyone s done something  Interviewer Right   I mean even if you re 19 right you ve um you ve done side projects and and interesting stuff Um and you know I think what s what s important is not to believe that someone has to have specifically done the job that they re going to do in order to be able to do it well One of the things that I think we ve done well is is just giving the people at the company a lot of opportunity Right So you know it s not just me who started when I was 19 and and now you know I m running this big company There were a number of people who joined who were you know people I did problem sets with at Harvard or they dropped out of Stanford or you know different programs who ve grown with the company over this long period of time and you know one of the things that I m the most proud of is we have about twelve different product groups at the company and all of the people who are running them um with the exception of of uh one uh did not join the company running a product group or reporting to me  Interviewer That s amazing   And the one exception was is David Marcus who was the CEO of a fifty billion dollar public company so um you know so I m pretty happy that that he s on board and having him run a product group I think is a pretty big coup too But literally none of them started off reporting to me Um you know they all started off in different in different roles Some were engineers Some were data analysts Um some were product managers and they ve all grown But I think what happens is you know people see that you create opportunities for people and and that also I think keeps the best people engaged and makes the best people want to come work at your company because they feel like oh I m going to get those kind of opportunities too  Interviewer Cool   Yeah  Interviewer What are you most excited about over the next twenty years What do you think will be the major transformations How will Facebook transform How do you think the rest of the world will transform   So we have this ten year roadmap  Interviewer Yeah that s great   Of you know three of the the big changes that we want to see in the world And we re focused on three things Connectivity so getting everyone in the world on the Internet Right now you know more than half the world in not on the Internet which is you know I think a lot of people in in Silicon Valley probably take this for granted right The the Internet because it just is not uniformly available and if we want to solve a lot of the the big challenges of the world today they re not problems that any one group of people or even one country can solve right They they really involve coming together and giving everyone an opportunity to participate in in solving them Um so I think connecting everyone is is really a key thing which is going to um be be great for for people around the world Uh the next one is AI Uh I think that that s just going to unlock so much potential in so many different domains You know we use it at Facebook for a lot of different things from showing people content that they re going to find more meaningful um for making sure that you um connect with the people you actually care about on the service But in a lot of ways the work that we re doing on AI to push the fundamental uh you know state of the art forward is exactly the same stuff that s going into systems that diagnose diseases better right Or find better drugs to treat people or um that you know other companies are using when they build self driving cars And you know these are things that are going to save lives Right I mean if you can You know I heard this story recently that at this conference where someone has built um a machine learning application where you can take a picture of a a legion on someone s skin and it can detect instantly uh whether it s skin cancer with the accuracy of the best dermatologists and doctors in the world So you know I mean who doesn t want that  Interviewer That s amazing   Right Now you re going to be able to put the power in your doctor s hand uh to become the best doctor in the world at that thing Everyone will be the best doctor in the world And that s a really fundamental thing right that um You know I I get a little bit frustrated I think when people um you know fearmonger about about AI and how it it could end up hurting people because I I think in in many real ways around diseases or around driving more safely I mean this is going to save people s lives and and push people forward So that that s a really big deal I think for the next ten years And then you know the next thing that that I always think is is going to make a big difference is um you know every ten or fifteen years there s a new major computing platform that comes around that allows people to do completely different things than they could do before right So you know twenty years ago you know most of us were using desktop computers They were kind of clunky You know we used them in work because it made our work more productive but most people didn t use them for fun Now we have phones which you know help us connect with each other and they re much more human devices But there s going to be another platform after that and I think that s going to be uh virtual reality and augmented reality Um and that I think is just going to help people you know be more creative um experience what other people are feeling much more immersively than than we even can through um through video and things like that today so uh I m really excited about that trend as well  Interviewer So you were nineteen when you started Facebook Um one question we hear a lot at Y Combinator is I m nineteen today I really want to you know do whatever I can to make the world better What should I do So so how do you advise people who are nineteen today and want to impact the world like you have   You know I I always think that the most important thing that entrepreneurs should do is pick something they care about work on it but don t actually commit to turning it into a company until it s working And I think that if you look at the data of like the very best companies that have gotten built I I actually think a tremendous percent of them have been built that way and not from people who decided up front that they wanted to start a company because you just get locked into some local minimum a lot of the time A local maximum sorry  Interviewer I totally agree and just to make this point how how far into Facebook did it actually become a company   Um I don t know I think probably I think it became a a formal Delaware company when Peter Thiel invested about six months in When we were first talking to Peter about raising money Dustin and I were very clear with him that we were planning on going back to school Our um you know I I started Facebook when I was a sophomore We took the summer off No classes over the summer we were working on it And then you know our our stated game plan was to go back to school in the fall and continue working on it then but not like sit in an office and work on it full time and Peter was just kind of like all right sure you are I I guess he knew better than we did  Interviewer You think he just believed that you weren t actually going to go back to school   Uh he must ve I mean you d have to ask him but  Interviewer I will We re interviewing him in this series I will ask him   There you go So I I think he would probably say that he knew we were not going to go back to school or believed that he could talk us out of it but he didn t have to It it was pretty clear that the amount of work was just growing so quickly But we actually didn t drop out immediately We we told Harvard that we were taking one semester off and and then we told Harvard that we were taking another semester off And then a year off and then after that we kind of decided we weren t going back  Interviewer Uh speaking of Peter and this is sort of a closing question what what s the best piece of advice he ever gave you   I think Peter was the person who who told me this really pithy quote that in a world that s changing so quickly the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk And I I really think that that s true Right I mean a lot of people I think think that um you know whenever it comes to whenever you get yourself into a position where you have to make some some big shift in direction or do something um there are always people are going to point to the the downside risks of that decision And locally they re maybe right Right I mean for any given decision that you re going to make there s upside and downside but in aggregate If you are stagnant and you don t make those changes then um then I thin you re guaranteed to fail right and not not catch up So to some degree I I think it s really right that over time the biggest risk that you can take is to not take any risks  Interviewer That is a great place to leave it Thank you very much  All right '}\n"

      "{'filename': '2016-023', 'content': '   Applause Hi Hi thank you It s it s so great it s it s so great to be here with you guys at University of Luiss Thank you for hosting me this this afternoon Applause Now before we get started I want to say a few words about the earthquake You know our our hearts go out to all of the people who have lost a home or have lost a loved one or know someone who is affected by the earthquake It s really hard to imagine I think what it s like to just in an instant have your your whole life turned upside down like that And you know in moments like this it s it s heartbreaking but also seeing how the community here in Italy and around the world I have been able to come together to rally for the people who ve been affected by the disaster and those who love them um seeing people come together and connect is I always find really inspiring And the spirit of the people here in Italy that we are going to get through this and we are going to rebuild and it s going to take awhile but you are going to make it happen I think is really inspiring to people all around the world Now I I know that this is going to be a topic that we want to talk about a bunch today and there are going to be a number of questions about this I I look to the thread I think the top inaudible 00 01 45 question is about this so we are going to get to that in a second uh but I just wanted to lead with that upfront and share that I I feel uh what we are what we are going through here Now Applause Now being here being in this part of the world also brings out other emotions for me because I love Rome Laughs I love Rome Applause Um Um I studied uh I I studied Latin and Roman history and culture and I I loved it so much that when I thought when I was going to college I actually thought I was going to major in Classics I I didn t I ended up majoring in Computer Science and Psychology but I didn t make it that long in college anyway So so you know that doesn t not not a big thing Um but but I I love I love Rome I love Rome so much that when my wife and I got married we came here on our honeymoon And I I made us go to all of these different historical and classical places so much so that when we got back and we were looking through the photos my wife was making fun of me that she thought that there were three people on the honeymoon me her and Augustus As we looked back all the photos had just different sculptures of Augustus around the city you know the Prima Porta the um Augustus home the Ara Pacis So all all the favorites got to got to go to the hits if you are going to be here in Rome so Um so uh I love Rome I love the culture here It s great to be here with all of you today I m really happy to have the opportunity to share a part of Facebook s culture with you which is these town hall Q As Now every week every Friday afternoon for probably about ten years now we ve been doing an open Q A where anyone at the company can come and ask me any question they want about what we are doing And you know I think it s this great cultural tradition that we have not only for me to have the opportunity to share what I m thinking and what s going on across the company butalso for me to be able to learn what you know people are thinking right and what what I should be thinking about that I m missing So a few years ago we started doing this with our community too and we started doing town hall Q As around the world So I could learn not just from you know people within our company but also people in our community all around the world what we should be thinking about and doing differently So that s what I hope to do today I m looking forward to hearing your questions hearing your ideas sharing some of how we think about things and hopefully taking some things back to Facebook in California that we can use to help serve the whole community all across the world better So thank you guys so much for coming out here today uh let s get started Applause  Speaker 1 Thank you very much Mark So the top question as you were saying before actually comes from the thread and is related to the earthquake It comes from Marcelo Mark are you coming to Italy and I m really happy for it should be great if you could leave a sign here in my country to help the people of central Italy who lost everything yesterday night Money words any possible way to help   Yeah So you know when I first learned about the earthquake you know it just made me incredibly sad right And you know our first reaction is we have to do everything we can to help out And you know since then we ve been thinking about what are the ways that Facebook and our community can pull together to do uh the most that that we can You know the biggest thing and I think the most important is this program that we run called Safety Check And what it basically is is it lets people whenever there is a disaster an earthquake hurricane attack tell their friends that they are safe right It notifies them it sends a notification And you know I think this is so important because when you are in a disaster or when when someone you love is in a disaster you know all you want to know is that they are safe right Now the Safety Check that that we ran in last week and because of the community here in Italy was one of the most effective that we ve ever seen across the world and what that means is that of the people who are in the region that was affected by the earthquake of the people who are on Facebook or use Facebook almost half of them use Safety Check to mark themselves as safe and that sent notifications reassuring their family that they were okay to more than 15 million people around the world So that s a pretty important tool in times like this but we also wanted to do more So we we started working with the Red Cross in Italy and we gave them 0 5 million in ad credits and sat down with them to help them use the Facebook platform to help get whatever they needed from our community right So whether that s uh supplies volunteers uh donations for blood whatever they needed right because what what I think we all know is that you know when a disaster like this happens you know there is a lot of media attention for a short period of time and you know people talk about it but then you know the real pain and the real rebuilding happens over a long period of time right So you want to empower good organizations like the Red Cross who can stay focused on this for much longer than the cameras are going to be uh focusing on on what s going on here So that s what what we are trying to to do here You know the third thing that I m pretty proud of when I see is you know people who are part of the community here in Italy are using the tools to to rally right and and support the community overall So one story that that particularly touched me was there was a restaurant that posted on their Facebook page that for every dish of I I hope I don t mispronounce this inaudible 00 08 02 how we doing All right good thank you Um that they serve they are going to set aside 1 to go to the disaster relief effort And they used Facebook to not only say that they were doing this but encourage other restaurants around the country to participate as well and so far 700 different restaurants have signed up to do this pledge as well And you know that s just an awesome example of this community coming together to help other people in in Italy and all over the world wherever you are And you know that s the thing that I feel like we can uniquely do and we have a responsibility to do and we want to do to make sure that that we can help the folks who are who are here as much as possible Applause  Speaker 1 We we ll now take a question from the room Let me look around you are all very shy You had a question so don t forget to stand up present yourself and you can make your question  Speaker 2 Hi Mark I m Alasio 00 09 10 and we have all seen the incredible success of Pok mon Go with augmented reality And how much do you think this is going to change our social life And if Facebook will manage to change our life as much as Pok mon Go with inaudible 00 09 30 Oculus Rift Thank you   You know it s I m glad you asked that because the real reason I came to Rome was to to find some rare Pok mon Applause Laughs I I went for a run this morning past the Colosseum and people thought I was doing that because I want to be healthy uh I was just trying to find this one rare Pok mon that I ve heard hangs out there You know but in all seriousness you know I think that virtual reality and augmented reality are going to be the most social platform that has ever existed Right and if you think about the history of computing right every 10 or 15 years a big new computing platform comes along right So we had desktop computers and then we had browsers and the internet and now we have mobile phones And you know that it s great and each one is better than the one before it but what we have now is not the end of the line right We are going to get to a point wherein five or ten years we are all using virtual or augmented reality um probably more like ten years than five for everyone to use it And the thing that sets virtual reality apart is that you feel like you re really there likeyou are like you are present And you know if you think about it you look at a photo or a video on a screen or at a TV or a computer or a phone and you are kind of trying to get your mindset in this uh perspective of as as if you re there right You are trying to pretend you see the photo of something and you are trying to kind of imagine what it s like to be there But virtual reality is different because it actually it kind of it s programmed to work exactly the way that your brain does So if if anything when you when you look at it you feel like you re in that place like you are present Uh and if anything you are you are trying to convince yourself that you are not actually there because you know as you look around you are you are seeing as if as if it s the the real world So you know you can imagine in the future how you are going to be able to feel like you are right there with another person who couldn t necessarily be with you in person right So I think about my family when I m not there you know my my daughter right I mean she is she is in California right now Right now I miss her and I think to be able to feel like I m right there with her would just be a really powerful social experience inaudible 00 12 00 want to have You know in terms of augmented reality right so there is virtual reality where you feel completely immersed and then there is augmented reality where you are kind of adding virtual elements onto the world And what I think we are going to see there is that that s going to come to mobile phones first before we get some kind of smart glasses that overlay stuff in the world So you are going to see apps like Pok mon Go you are going to see things like face filters like we have in our MSQRD app we just launched this test for the Olympics in Brazil and Canada where people could support their country by putting face paint on We didn t launch it here in Italy because it was just a test to start but we hope to once we we get that further along And I I think there are going to be a bunch of tools like that that kind of overlay real things from the world on top of your experience and inaudible 00 12 47 things that we are going to see soon Applause  Speaker 2 Hey Mark Hey Mark we have a question from the back here so here we are  Martina Hi my name is Martina and I m studying computer engineering I would like to ask you how important are our origins in your opinion Inaudible 00 13 11 in Italy have more difficultly emerging than the Americans What advise will you give to Italians   Well I think more than ever now great ideas are coming from everywhere Right I mean as the internet spreads it used to be that you were constrained to where you could build a business by where you were but now you can build something and serve people all around the world right And I ve had a couple of examples that I ve seen of this uh just on this trip so far right So right before I came to Rome I was I was actually at the wedding of one of my close friends who is a great European entrepreneur Daniel Ek Uh he is the Founder ofSpotify Not not from Italy but but from Europe overall And most of the people that he serves are not from his country right Another example and I think you know one of our winners of our FbStart program that we do across the world to help developers build different tools and build businesses Max Ciociola uh I I heard might be here Is that right There he is You want to stand up for a second The Founder of of a company Applause Thanks for coming out Uh I think you are doing great work a Founder of the company Musixmatch building crowdsourced lyrics for uh for songs And you know I think what we are seeing though is that more than ever now we have the ability to wherever we come from to put an idea online and see where it resonates And you know I think in Italy especially what we see with the community here is that more people use Facebook to actually connect with businesses small and medium businesses than almost any other country in the world Of the I think it s about 29 million people in Italy are on Facebook So it s about 90 of people are on the internet Um nine in ten of of people in Italy are connected to a small and medium business which is is is a standout for what we see across the worlds which I think means that if you are interested in starting a business here in Italy um that s a pretty good entrepreneurial culture and community that you have here of people who want to engage So um so I d be optimistic and and just focus on what you want what you want to build and bring it to the world Applause  Speaker 2 So then we got another question from the room So we have a question here Christina Hi Mark I m Christina Uh failure is mostly seen in Italy as something bad but I knowFacebook s culture is different This is why I d like to ask you have you ever failed inyour life And what did you learn about failure Thanks   Yeah it s it s a great question Uh you know I think a lot of entrepreneurship is learning as quickly as you can because no one starts off knowing everything that they are going to need to build something So the best thing that you can do is not not study as much as you can before or not pretend that you know everything It s going to it with this mindset that your job is to learn as much as you can as quickly as you can And you know try to have this mindset that you know in the end I don t think we are judged by our our failures I think we are judged by the change that we make in the world And you know when you fail you just you know whatever that idea was it just didn t reach whatever impact you were hoping for You know one of my favorite stories I love reading about famous scientists And you know one of my favorite stories is is biography of Albert Einstein And it talks about all these things that he just totally messed up right I mean he is well known for the theory of relativity which of course changed the world in so many ways right changed fundamental physics changed how we think about energy uh changed how we think about the whole universe But his belief in that alsoled him to make a lot of mistakes right It led him to think that there can possibly be black holes because his belief that space time was this beautiful thing it led him to think that black holes are a rip in space time that can t possibly be So in some ways you know he was kind of against that He was a little bit against quantum mechanics and those two 00 17 38 has ended up being wrong of his But in the end of the day you know no one really remembers that right What people remember is the the good stuff that he did and how he experimented along the way to learn improve his theory of relativity which ended up making such a big impact on uh on on the last century and going forward And I think that the more that we can remember that and build that into our entrepreneurial culture I think the more great ideas and and people will will succeed around the world because at the end of the day it really isn t how you fail it s what you take away from that and do going forward Applause  Speaker 1 Now we have another question from the thread We also need to to respond to the questions arriving from the thread So uh it is from Jackoma 00 18 24 from Luiss University so one of your colleagues Uh he would like to know something quite personal so what are the three top personal qualities to reach the top in your opinion   Huh um so I think if you want to build something great you should focus on what the changes that you want to make in the world Well that to me is number one But I see too many entrepreneurs who decide that they want to start a company before they actually know what it is that they want to build And to me that just seems backwards right You know building a company is you are going to change a lot you are going to need to learn a lot along along the way So it really make sense to go in with an idea of what uh what the impact is that you are going to want to do not not that you want to you know have a bunch of people working for you or or want to start a company or something like that The second is that no one does it alone right So you need to get the best you need to build the best team that you can right I think that there is this myth in the world that of kind of the Founder right the individual you know a lot of people they talk about me and Facebook and it drives me a little crazy because I think that that understates that this is a big team effort right I mean we have a lot of people working on Facebook now thousands and even at the beginning there were a bunch of people who were working on it and when you look at most big things that get done in the world they are not done by one person So you know you are going to need to build a team And so you are going with the idea of what you what you want to do in the world And and the next most important thing that you are going to do is is just surround yourself with the best people that you can to learn from uh because you know youare going to need to learn over time and you are going to need people who have complementary skills because you are not no matter how talented you are you know there are just going to be things that you don t bring to the table And that s certainly true for me Uh we our company works because we have a really talented core team of people who complement me who have different skills that I don t that I don t have And then the third thing that I would say is just persistence right So nothing ever goes the way you want it to right People talk about overnight success and it s that s not the way it works right Overnight success happens after you work for a long period of time uh to to build something then one day you wake up and people go This is successful just appeared And you know that s never how you experience it when you are actually working on it And so you know all the when you are building something you are just going through all these trials and tribulations along the way and you know I think a lot of people give up right and that takes different forms right It s you don t have the you don t push through to see through what you believe Um some people um sell their company before it reaches its full potential some people change the direction um some people leave But you know I think the the biggest things that have gotten done in the world are are tend to be done by people who primarily believe in a mission and are not trying to build a company uh first and foremost by by teams not by individuals and by people who just don t give up Applause  Speaker 2 So Mark now we have a we have a question from a video from inaudible 00 21 44  Speaker 4  Foreign language 00 21 49   You got to translate that for me  Speaker 2  Laughs So the the question is basically is which are the main strengths that made Facebook so successful   Hmm I think it s that we focus on learning right It s I mean the last question was a little bit similar in that You know I think in order to build an organization you want to build an organization that s focused on on mission and your purpose above all that has a strong team and that is is very focused um and doesn t give up when when things get tough But you know I think more than anything um you also need to build an organization that that is focused on learning right And you know great ideas come from everywhere right they come from listening to our community uh they they come from our employees they come from doing research they come from other companies who are doing interesting things in this space And and our job is to just learn as much as we can uh to build the best things that we can for our community right So I I can give you one of my favorite examples about this I I I think when you are building a company you want to set yourself up to just learn as as quickly as you can And for us one of the ways that we do that is by empowering all these different people at Facebook We have thousands and thousands of engineers and you know if every idea had to go through me then the company would probably go pretty slowly right If everyone had to run by by me what they wanted to do So instead what we ve done is we ve build this whole system where any engineer can just experiment with um with their own idea right So you can you can build something you can try something out and you can you can release into the world not to the whole community right so not to more than a billion people but you can roll it out to maybe 10 000 people or 100 000 people or a lot of a lot of people in the community to see how they like it and you get feedback right So every every engineer does this and they they get feedback on you know how their idea and their version of Facebook that they have built helps people share Does it help people more than than the other versions or less Um how connected do people feel How happy do they feel Um you know how informed do they feel by the news and their newsfeed Um how much do they enjoy the ads or the businesses that they interact with And when someone ships an ideas that s good then we incorporate that into the version of Facebook that we ship for all billion people around the world And if it s not a good idea then we catalog it and we we write down what the idea was that we won t keep on repeating it but we ve learned that lesson and then we go on and do different stuff But a lot of what we are trying to do is empower the organization to learn as many lessons as it can as quickly as possible And you know if someone tests something and it doesn t work then that s not the end of the world we are just going to the next idea and keep learning But you know that s how over the last 12 years we ve been able to stay ahead and keep building things at a faster rate than all the other competitors and other folks in the space is that we are just really focused on learning as quickly as we can because we know that we don t have all the ideas today And that you know building a company over the long term is about having a lot of ideas it s not just one at the beginning So that s what we need to do Applause  Speaker 1 So now we are going to take another question from the room and I know there was one here don t forget to present yourself  Alexandro Hi I m Alexandro and I have a question about your plane Aquila How did you get this idea and how do you think it s going to influence the future of undeveloped countries like Africa where people still don t have access to the internet   Yeah So if you want to connect everyone in the world helping everyone get on the internet is really important And you know it turns out today you know even though we all have phones right and use the internet that more than half of people in theworld today are not on the internet So that is just a really important problem that we want to help solve for the world in the next 10 or 15 years And it it turns out that the internet is really important for a lot of people beyond just staying connected or beyond knowing what s going on with your friends and family You the internet also helps deliver uh really important tools like education right If you live in a place where there is not a good school then the internet is one of your best bets for getting education information Or if you live in a place and you don t have access to a good doctor and you know you want to know if your your child is sick or something like that then the internet is one of your best tools to be able to do that So there is a lot of research that shows that for every ten people who get on the internet about one person gets lifted out of poverty and new jobs get created So you know for three or four billion people around the world who are not on the internet one of the best things that we can do is help connect everyone around the world And it turns out that there are a few big issues that that are blocking people from using the internet So the first is uh is is kind of the infrastructure right There are a lot of people who you know even if you had a phone there there would be no network around where you are right And that s the problem that Aquila is trying to solve right If you live in some remote area then what we are going to do is we we ve designed this plane that can fly uh over your village or your your town and can stay there for three or six months at a time and it s almost like a cell phone tower in the sky and it beams down internet access to people so they can have access to the internet no matter where they are Uh there are other problems too right So another problem is is cost right So it s not just some people have access there is internet where they live uh but they can t afford to use it So for that you know we need to do a number of things We need to make it so that we we make the cost of using the internet cheaper and we could do that both by making data rates less expensive We have programs to do that and by making inaudible 00 27 55 our apps use less data right So that s uh that s a big effort that we have In the last few years we ve actually inaudible 00 28 01 our Facebook app It uses 1 10th as much data as it did before So if you are paying per bit uh to to use the internet then now using Facebook costs only 10 of what it did before So there there is a lot more that we can do and empower other developers to do And the third category that I think is important to talk about too is that there are a lot of people who um who actually can afford to use the internet and there is a network but you know they didn t grow up with the internet right Maybe they didn t have a computer or they just never used the internet so if you go up to them and you ask Do you Do you want to pay for a data plan Their first question is you know Why why would I want to pay for a data plan So we need to show why the internet is valuable and that s why we have this program Free Basics uh which goes and and gives people some free services on the internet for free which then after people experience the internet they end up realizing why it s so valuable to connect and and connecting more broadly So you know the internet connectivity efforts that we ve done at Facebook so far have already connected uh more than 25 million people around the world It s it s a small impact uh against the the billions of people who don t have access and need it but we are ramping up its growing quickly and I I think efforts like Aquila are are going to help a lot on this too Applause  Speaker 2 So Mark Mark we have another question from the back   All right  Speaker 5 Hi Mark I m Danielle 00 29 29 you talked about the Safety Check earlier and I d like to ask you is it going to change in the future Um will users be able to activate it on their own perhaps to alert other people Or is it going to change   Yes it is we are working on that already You know and it s not so the the way that we think about this for for the product is that you know there are certain moments of truth is is what we call them internally right which are are basically right If you are a social product about building community and relationships then when there is a crisis whether it s you know a natural disaster or an attack um or you know a child goes missing um or a friend is sick You know the most important thing that I think we can do is is help make sure that people are safe and protected right And you know if if what you are building is a community product um you know I think that this is one of the moments of truth for us right It s it s how we judge whether Facebook is successful or what we are supposed to be doing is not just on whether you can share the photo of your fun moment your fun night out with your friends or your cute photo of your child uh but it s also it s whether whether our community is strong enough and we give people the tools to keep people safe in in those situations So you know we are we are working on what you say right because when Safety Check got started a couple of years ago it was only for natural disasters right earthquakes and hurricanes Unfortunately since then we we ve had to expand its to deal with terrorist attacks too right because that s just been unfortunately too common right over the last few years And the next thing that we need to do is make it so like communities can trigger it themselves when there is some disaster But there are other things like this too that I want to see us do right So it s not just that it s AMBER Alerts right this program that we have in the US and Canada and a number of countries If a child goes missing we want to make sure that our community can help find that child and we have in a number of cases right it s it s suicide prevention right If someone uh posts that that they are you know thinking of of killing themselves and you know someone sees that then we want to make sure that we empower our community to help their friends or their loved one reach the right resources um at the right time right And that s a matter of life and death And you know we are really proud of the impact that we ve been able to have there in in the early places where we ve rolled that out And then you know there are things like giving people the ability to organize to donate blood and come together in different ways that we want to make sure that we push as well But for us this is so core to the mission and we judge ourselves by how well Facebook and our community perform in these moments of truth And so you bet that we are going to want to work on this for the future Applause  Speaker 3 So Mark we have now another question coming from video Taihu Kim from Canada  Taihu Hi Mark my name is Taihu and I m a second year medical student in Canada originally from South Korea Today I d like to ask you how you motivate yourself at work to stay on track I like to be able to use my 24 hours more efficiently Thank you Bye Applause   I don t know Hmm You know I don t actually I mean I think I can do a lot better at that So um I m not sure I have the answer to that Well you know I think that s the answer Um so you know I always think that there is more that we can do And I ve I never thought about in these terms before but this is something that my my family has really taught me Um you know and I think about it it s something that my parents taught me but I think it actually goes back even further than that I mean it s um you know in the United States people come as immigrants right and its people who come because they ve hope that they want to make their their life better and for their children And they come and they work hard And my grandparents grew up and went through this economic depression and sold whatever they could on the street right to make sure that my my parents could grow up and have a good life And they they taught them that you had to work hard and that they passed along this hope that you could just kind of always do better and that you could always use your time better and have a bigger impact on the world And my my parents took that and then they studied really hard right because my grandparents kind of made them that they pushed them that was the big push and um they wanted to do more And my parents both became doctors And and they taught they taught me this and and my my sisters that you know we had a responsibility to do everything we can with with our time here on on this Earth to to just have the biggest impact that we can I remember real really vividly when I was growing up my mom sat me down one day at lunch and said you know Your father and I are both doctors and we are happy with the impact that we are able to have but you have a responsibility to help even morepeople Right because you have you are growing up with the ability to learn how to do more things and I don t know I mean I I just think you know especially for for where where I am and you know what what Facebook is at this point I just I I wake up every day and I feel this deep responsibility to you know we don t have that many days here right And you know I feel like we have to make the biggest impact that we can both at at Facebook and and in our philanthropy And you know it s taken on new meaning for me in the last year because you know now I have a daughter and you know I feel like in this family progression I want to make sure that I can pass along that hope and that ethic to her and do my part in making sure that she and everyone in her generation can have a better life as well but I ve never thought about it like that before Yeah Applause  Speaker 1 So we have a question from the live thread so from people following us live And it comes from Partha Hegde it s a very personal question How is Max   She is good I miss her This is the I think this is the longest I have been apart from her And I mean like I wake up in the morning and she sees me and she starts crawling towards me And it s I mean it s like the happiest thing I mean nothing has made me happier in my life than you see your daughter and she can t walk yet soon maybe Laughs And but just seeing the the joy on her face and it s like she is doing what she can to to get to me uh I don t know there is nothing like that right But she is awesome she is doing well I m I m very proud of her  Speaker 1 That is great Applause We have a video now another video from Davida 00 37 09 from Napoli  Speaker 7 Hi my name is inaudible 00 37 15 from Naples I have a question about the role of Facebook in the media Do you see it as an editor Thank you very much   No Laughs You know we are technology company but we are not a media company When you think about a media company it s you know you have people are producing content who are editing content And you know that s not us we are a technology company we build tools we do not produce any of the content We exist to give you the tools to curate and have the experience that you want to connect with the people and businesses and institutions in the world that you want right So every person gets to program their own Facebook experience right You choose who your friends are who you want to follow um what businesses you want to follow um what other institutions And in that way you know one of the cool things I think about social media is that I think it s the most diverse form of media that has ever existed right If you think about the way that media worked you know in the last generation and before the internet you know we had TV but we had newspapers but there usuallyweren t that many TV stations or newspapers that other kind of news that you d want to watch right So maybe there were three or four stations right and they all kind of covered the same thing right maybe one different editorial slant on it Same thing with newspapers right There are probably few in any given area and there are different editorial views You kind of pick the one that you wanted to to read and you ve got all of your information from that But now think about the internet and think about social media and think about your feed right I mean you now have the chance to connect with people all over all over the world right One stuff that I love is the average person in Europe who uses Facebook has I think it s more than 50 friends from outside their country right So now you are not just getting your news from around you but you are connected to and and getting updates from people all around the world right all around the continent and all around other places And you know most people you know a lot of your friends might share your views but most people have some friends who don t right who come from different backgrounds who have different ethnic backgrounds different ideas different political philosophies and you are going to see their content too which is very different from what you d see in a newspaper or a TV station where you just kind of get all your news from one place So you know I think that we are really proud of our role as a technology company and not a media company in this I think the world needs this the world needs media companies too but I think the world also needs technology platforms um like what we do and we we take our role in this very seriously Applause  Speaker 2 Another another question from the back Here we are  Speaker 8 Hi Mark it s inaudible 00 40 19 have you ever thought that Facebook has changed and maybe ruined how people communicate to each other I mean I m a frequently user I m not saying anything bad but it s true that in the past people used to communicate with real smile face to face more often than now So isn t it    Laughs No No If I thought that we ruined communication I d just change our product I mean think about it If you re working on something and you thought you broke something that was really important in the world when you just changed what you re doing I I d hope so I m getting some blank faces um  Laughs When you start businesses I I hope the answer to that is yes Uh here is how I think about this You know Facebook doesn t people don t mostly use it for communicating uh for replacing the face to face interactions that they have It s for making inaudible 00 41 18 so you can communicate with people who you wouldn t otherwise have the opportunity to connect with right So when I m hanging out with my family or with my wife I don t go to the other room and then talk to her on Facebook right I mean that s not that d not be good you knowwhat I mean Nothing replaces face to face interaction um although in the future hopefully virtual reality will help get close for when you re not there but what it does is it gives you the ability to stay in touch with people who you wouldn t have the ability to do with otherwise Or it s my sister who lives on the other side of the country from me and I want to know what s going on with her kids right So I can see her updates on Facebook right and she can send me messages on Facebook messenger and and Whatsapp throughout theday keeping me posted And if she didn t have those tools then you know I have to wait until she traveled out to California or I traveled out to New York or I got on the phone with her which you know unfortunately just happened more rarely than I d like And I think we can all kind of relate to this There are probably people in your life who you just you wouldn t be in touch with if you didn t have those updates in the background maybe you are not close with them enough to go visit them or to call them but you like seeing what they are up to from time to time And you know that s what Facebook does And I I definitely don t think that that s ruining anything I think that that s augmenting what we already do Well we all we have the tools to stay connected with the people who are right around us we love the most And now we also have technology that helps to stay connected with people that we love and care about no matter where there are Applause  Speaker 1 So Mark we have another question from the thread from Alessandro from Milan He asks uh where did you study Latin Why did you decide to study it And he also comments on the fact that it s not common for Americans to study Latin or Greek So what would you say to that Mark   Wow Uh so I started studying when I was in high school And and I have to be honest here I m not very good at languages I I actually started initially studying in Latin because when I was in middle school they offered Spanish and French and I was terrible at both of them And I m I love languages I m just really bad at them I ve actually studied seven different languages in my life if you if you count English And you know but the part that s really hard for me is speaking So Latin you don t have to speak Laughs It s so that s how I I got into it originally And then then I just kind of fell in love with it and I thought All right this is awesome I love the culture I love the history I love learning about stuff Um you know I was I was thinking about this on on the way over I m like all right I got to I got to be able to relate there are so many good uh classical Roman entrepreneurship stories I got to got to be able to drop one at this this town hall Q A or else what would what would this be what would this whole trip to Rome be if I couldn t talk about Latin in some way So um so again I m going to go pretty basic on this How many of you guys have have studied inaudible 00 44 28 Okay wow Um how many of you guys studied Latin Allright there you go All right that s good And you know there are a lot of people who are watching this live who uh who have not studied Latin or read the inaudible 00 44 46 you know I think we ll appreciate this bit of Roman culture Um so you know one of my favorite stories that I think of is like the ultimate entrepreneurship story is is inaudible 00 44 56 right because basically you have Aeneas and his family and his crew they are leaving Troy right The the Greeks have just burnt down their beloved city and they re looking to find the next place where they are going to live And and found a new a new place And they leave and you know unbeknownst to Aeneas he has uh really angered the gods So immediately upon upon leaving you know there is this huge storm in the water and the vast majority of their ships are just immediately destroyed So not only does has their city just been burnt to the ground but now most of the crew who who made it out and fled the city um did not make it through just the first part of the voyage too And there is this very famous line which is probably my favorite line of all all in Latin I think it s line 202 of the first Book although I may be wrong  Foreign language 00 45 56 And that he says uh as he is kind of on this this these rocks being beached that you know this is this is a terrible situation but perhaps one day uh we will even look back on this fondly And of course he goes on to found to later his his his progeny goes on to found Rome right You know one of the greatest cultures and and and cities in the history of the world And you know I kind of think about this this is like the perfect entrepreneurship story right I mean he the guy has a clear mission right I mean he is he is not out for himself he is out there to serve his people and his community and build something much greater than himself He wants to found a new city for his people and a great city Um and he is not doing it alone right he has this whole team of of people and you know the fierce spirit of of the Trojans And and of course it doesn t help to have some gods on your side which I think is probably true is entrepreneurship and building a business too Uh and but more than anything he doesn t give up and he just kind of keeps on pushing and pushing and he succeeds And now we all have this beautiful amazing city um at least because of the myth that that that that that was him uh and and his crew And I just think that that s kind of the perfect entrepreneurship story of mission team perseverance everything that you need to do to build something great and lasting in the world and one of the most beautiful classic Roman and Latin pieces of of art Applause And you know I know we are here to talk about technology and not Latin but you got to humor me because I love this stuff Laughs There is no way I m going to come to Rome and not tell a Latin story  Speaker 2 So looking for question  Kara Hi Mark my name is Kara and I m marketing student Facebook has entered in our life and has completely changed the dynamics of economic markets worldwide For this reason I ask you what advise will you give to all young people who deeply love what they do and will have an important role in the future in this area Thank you   The most important thing that I that I think I can say is that you have the tools to build what you want right I I remember when I was studying computer science in college for that short period of time that you know I remember thinking Okay I m taking these classes but one day somewhere out there there are people who do this for real right I m just learning these classes but there is real programming I remember actually really specifically the night that I released the first version of Facebook thinking that some other real company out there was going to build this for the world because there is no way that a bunch of college students who didn t know anything about business were going to uh be able to build something like this better than big companies that have thousands of engineers and are already serving hundreds of millions of people and had millions of servers and all that But it turned out that we we actually kind of knew what we needed to right And there is there is some media myths about entrepreneurship that I think are actually pretty disempowering right The idea that you have to do everything yourself right that there is kind of the founder myth that we talked about before um I think is really disempowering because it makes you feel like if you can t do everything yourself then maybe you can t build something But I think that that is it s kind of it s wrong right I mean nothing great has ever been built by just one person Um similarly I think the uh uh there is a lot of mythology that great ideas or things that are big come fully formed as an idea And you if you don t kind of have your big thing that you want to go do then you know you should go home because you know you can t compare it to the other people who do But you know that s not how anything works in the world right Nothing ever comes out fully formed right people start because they have something that they care about and you work on it and you care about it And a lot of the time I think it s just because you care more that you end up succeeding and pushing hard I think that s definitely the the story of Facebook Well there is no reason why those other companies couldn t have built what we ve built Uh we were college students we had many fewer resources We built it because we just cared more and they didn t And I think the same is going to be true for you and a lot of other folks as well And you know so if you just believe um which I think is true that you already know what you need to and you have the tools um to go into this and at least get started You are going to learn a ton along the way but you know you need to get started then on then you can go for it Applause  Speaker 1 There was one question here Please inaudible 00 51 13  Speaker 9 Um it s Roberto student in Luiss inaudible 00 51 19 com I d to ask at what stage are you with the development of your personal Jarvis And when can we buy one   Oh You know making progress and I hope to have a demo hopefully next month And you know so for one of my personals Every year I do these personal challenges So right one year I was I studied Mandarin recently which was especially hard because I m bad at languages This year it s I ve two one uh one of the challenges was to build an AI system to help me control my home and do my work And then the other was to run an average of one mile a day So it turns out that one of those challenges is a lot easier than the other Laughs So the the running I finished about halfway through the year the AI still working on But you know I got it to this point where now it can I can control the lights I can control the gates I can control the temperature much to the chagrin of my wife who now cannot control the temperature because it is programmed to only listen to my voice which is one of the perks of being an engineer you you can do that I ll I ll give her access once I m done Um so it s it s getting there and it s starting to be able to do some pretty fun things and I m looking forward to being able to show it to the world I m I m really proud not only of you know just this quick demo that I ve been able to build but it s awesome because I get to interact with all these Facebook engineers who are doing all this awesome AI work right and in speech recognition and face recognition I programmed it to now when I walk up to my my door my gate I don t have to put in the code or something like that to get in or put in the key it just sees my face and it lets me in And I m so that that is pretty fun but it s there is some state of the art AI in there that it s been awesome to get a chance to work with our engineers at Facebook and really see on a day to day basis what they are doing and how far advance the work is that they are doing It s been a really cool experience so far and I m looking forward to showing it off next month  Speaker 2 So Monica we have a we have a question inaudible 00 53 32 from Brazil And the question is what s the future of education and how internet can improve it   So one thing that that we are really focused on is personalized learning right It s this idea that students learn better when they are not just in a class where the teacher is lecturing to everyone at the same pace but when people have the opportunity to learn it at the pace that they want to go right So if there is you know some subject that you you get really quickly than you can just go really far and not really quickly And if there is you know something that let s say you are not as good at math you can take as long as you need on each of the lessons on that So that I think is really important And then the other aspect of personalized learning is giving people the tools to learn in the way that that fits them All right so some people will learn best by partnering and working with other students or by listening to a teacher talking to a teacher Some people work best by playing games right some people work best bywatching videos or doing practice problems Then what we want to do is enable all students across the world to have the tools that they need to learn in the way that suits them at the pace that suits them and and that s something that I think the internet can really help with right It can help give teachers the tools that they need to teach their students in this kind of a personalized way So this is something that we are working on both at Facebook uh by building software for personalized learning and we are we are really happy we now have this in more than 100 schools starting in the US but hope to have this all around the world pretty soon And it s a big focus for us on our philanthropy as well The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative our our our big effort to help improve education among other things around the world is also funding a lot of different personalized learning models um to help spread this kind of model but you know I think I m really optimistic about personalized learning The results that we get from the initial schools that were doing it are really good It shows that you know students who are at the top of their class can get really far ahead by learning as quickly as they can Students who might be falling behind now don t need to fall behind because they could just take as long as they need on the lessons The results are really good and I m really excited to get this into to more teachers hands and more students hands around the world Applause  Speaker 1 And this is actually the last question guys I m sorry You had a question   We are having so much fun  Speaker 10 Thank you Hi Mark I m Maria Sola 00 56 12 and I d like to ask you how did you manage to keep your composure when you became so famous as you are Thank you   Oh You know some things change but most don t right You know I m still working with a lot of the same people that I have been working with you know from really early on It s it s one of the things that has been the most important to me is you know you have family you know my wife We ve actually known each other since before I started Facebook My my core team at Facebook you know I think of folks like Cheryl we ve been working together for around eight years now Chris Cox the person runs our our product team I ve been working with him for 10 years right Our Chief Technology Officer has been at the company for almost 10 years and you know one thing that I think you ll find is that you build these partnerships and they just keep on getting better and better and better over time right on the personal side and on and on the work side And you learn more and you you grow together and you know and it keeps you grounded and focused on what really matters which at the end of the day is helping people connect with the people they care about uh and reaching people no matterwhere they are and you know just coming in everyday and trying to do the best that we can for people all around the world But um I don t know those relationships I think are really the key All right Applause Thank you I really appreciate you guys coming out I love I love being here in Rome with you You can hopefully tell from my stories how '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2016-025', 'content': '  Next stop Lagos This is my first trip to sub Saharan Africa I ll be meeting with developers and entrepreneurs and learning about the startup ecosystem in Nigeria The energy here is amazing and I m excited to learn as much as I can Our first stop is the Co creation Hub Nigeria CcHUB in Yaba I got to talk to kids at a summer coding camp and entrepreneurs who come to CcHub to build and launch their apps I m looking forward to meeting more people here '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2016-026', 'content': '  I wanted to come to Lagos first because of the vibrant developer and entrepreneurial ecosystem that you guys have here Right as Emai was just taking about And you know so I ve been going around the world to different cities and we ve been doing town hall Q A s and sitting down I wanted to come to Lego s first because of the vibrant developer and entrepreneurial ecosystem uh that you guys have here Right as Emai was just talking about And you know so I ve been going around the world to different cities and we ve been doing town hall Q A s and sitting down with people in the Facebook community and hearing from them about how how they use our services and what we could do better And here in Lagos I wanted to not just sit down with people in our community but sit down with developers and entrepreneurs And the reason for that is there there s this energy here I mean you feel it as soon as you get off the plane right And it s um You know I think the world needs to see that Right And you know here in Lagos and across the continent things are changing really quickly right I mean the economy is shifting from a resource based economy to an entrepreneurial and knowledge based economy and you guys are the ones who are leading that change And not only remaking Lagos and Nigeria but shaping the whole continent and influencing how things are going to work around the world for the next generation And um I think that that s a story that is under appreciated in a lot of parts in the world I think that people often don t really have a sense for how much energy there is and what the entrepreneurial spirit is here and uh so I just wanted to have a conversation today and talk about that And um it s great to be here with all of you guys So So applause so what I m hoping to do is you know I m going to share a Facebook tradition with you which is you know we do these town hall Q A s every Friday at the company Where I sit down with any employee who wants to come and they can come and ask me any question they want And it s a great opportunity not only for me to share what I m thinking about or to answer peoples questions that they have about the company but also for me to learn Right And that s what I feel like I m here to do is You know this is my first trip here I have a lot to learn I want to hear what you What s on your minds Um you know the technical questions the entrepreneurial questions that you guys have about building businesses about the ecosystem uh anything that you want Um I m here to learn and I m grateful to have the opportunity to talk to you guys today So thank you for coming out and let s do this applause  Speaker 2 So before we go I just want to ask can we be do another round of applause Can we show him a proper warm Nigerian welcome applause Much better Thank you my country people   Thank you guys Thank you  Speaker 2 Okay do we have a first the question is from the thread and it s from someone 00 03 21 named Akleius and he asks Mark what impressions do you have of Nigeria on your first visit Do they align or contrast with the impressions that you ve had of the country and it s people before you came   Well the thing that s striking is the energy Right The entrepreneurial energy You know I think when you re trying to build something what ends up mattering the most is just who wants it the most Right A lot of the time and who cares the most to build it And you know you feel that here As soon as you get off the plane and land and start talking to people you feel that passion and that entrepreneurial energy and I can tell you true stories just from uh last night Right I talked to probably no more than 100 people and um was just really blown away First story I stopped at uh this training program in Andela Right That um that my that my foundation invested in to help train really talented folks uh across the continent to be world class engineers and work for companies around the world And um I sat down and the opportunity to meet uh this woman uh Blessing Uboi 00 04 48 and she told me this story about how she applied to the program and the first time she didn t get in but she that didn t stop her She showed up anyway laughter And she showed up again And they figured All right We got to give her a try laughter And she went through the training program and she crushed it laughter And now she is a top engineer uh working for a multinational company If you have that attitude you win Another story So right after that I went down the street and I stop by this little store uh and met this woman Rosemary Nguko 00 05 39 who is selling connectivity nearby using the Facebook Express Wifi Program So she already had a shop and she was already selling selling stuff to people who were coming by and she decided Hey I can grow my business further if I also started selling connectivity to the people who are who are nearby So she she got hooked up with some folks who work with Facebook And people in the Facebook community and hearing from them about how they use our services and what we could do better Here is Lagos I wanted to not just sit down with people in our community but sit down with developers and entrepreneurs And the reason for that is there s this energy here I mean you feel it as soon as you get off the plane right And it s um

selling stuff to people who were coming by and she decided Hey I can grow my business further if I also started selling connectivity to the people who are who are nearby So she she got hooked up with some folks who work with Facebook and this Express Wifi Program that we have to empower local entrepreneurs to spread connectivity and I asked her So how did you make this transition in your business Right How did you you know if people were coming to your business for one thing how did you train them or teach people that they could come and get connectivity And she s like Well it actually wasn t easy I had to I had to print out flyers and go all around town I had to evangelize myself I think she said she even hired dancers and I mean she got it done Right And she told me that she now in the months that the program has started now has 3 000 customers paying for connectivity And she told me that now her connectivity part of the business is bigger than the original part of the business that she had So she s running two jobs two companies That s entrepreneurship Right And I don t care what field you re in uh what you re trying to do I think when people talk about entrepreneurship a lot of people that talk about vision and ideas and that stuff is important but you know I think what really is important is hard work and just this drive If you want to do it if you care more than everyone else then you get it done And I think as soon as you step off the plane here in Lagos that s it s in the air You feel it applause  Speaker 3 All right We re going to take the next question from the room and um we have a question from Alex  Speaker 4 Okay Hi everyone My name is Alex Um my question is this Facebook is big but the truth is that there are lots of places that are still don t have Facebook have friends on Facebook and if I have friends that they are on Facebook it means that those are in communities that are on Facebook So what strategy does Facebook does Facebook have in place so for those in our communities to have access to these technologies and use this technologies   Yeah So if you want to connect everyone in the world then making sure that everyone has access to the internet is a really important thing Right And it turns out that across the world uh more than half of people don t have access to the internet and here in Nigeria that s true too So in whether what you care about is connecting people with their friends and family uh or helping people start businesses you know the internet is one of the most fundamental parts of infrastructure that I think needs to exist Right And you know here my trip here is mostly focused on entrepreneurship and developers right I I I just have met so many people who are building things that you know you meet you meet people like um went to the CC Hub in Yaba yesterday and I met this woman uh Teni Guiwo 00 14 36 uh who s building this company Lifebike Right It organizes blood donations uh so that people can give blood and it s get some to people who need them And you know you meet someone like that and you re just like All right This is a thing that needs to exist Right If everyone had the opportunity to build something like this then the world would be better place It turns out so I ve been to a lot of different cities I think that people all around the world are trying to build stuff like that If she can actually pull it off then she ll show a model that ll impact not just Lagos and not just Nigeria but countries all around the world Right If you had everyone on the internet then you d have more shots at getting that right You know we have a three part plan for spreading internet The first part is building infrastructure Right Making it so that no matter where you are in the world you can get access to a signal So that s stuff like you know where we re launching a satellite later this week to beam down connectivity We ve built these solar powered drones that are basically like a self phone tower in the sky that can go over really remote rural locations and beam down connectivity to make sure that the networks spread and reach everyone So that s the first part The second part of the plan is you need to make the network affordable Right Because it s not much good having the infrastructure if people can t afford to use it There are two parts to that One is building cheaper infrastructure so that way uh the companies that are building the infrastructure can charge less for it and still be profitable and sustainable and the second I think is on app developers like all of us to use less data Right In the last few years uh we ve had this big effort at Facebook to make it so that our apps now take one tenth the amount of data that they did a few years ago So that means that if you re using our apps now and you re paying by the megabit you re paying 1 10 of what you paid a few years ago so that makes the internet more affordable And the third part of the plan is uh is just making sure that people uh understand why the internet might be valuable for them to use That might be That s the most counter intuitive for entrepreneurs who I speak with because I mean you guys are all on the internet Right So a lot of you probably grew up with it and and kind of take for granted that this is something that s going to be really valuable but if you grew up and you didn t have access to the internet and someone showed up and said Hey do you want to buy a data plan Uh you re first question would probably be What do I get for that Or Why do I want to pay for this even if I have the money to that So you know we re working on programs like Free Basics which is now live and in 22 countries across the continent uh to make it so that people can access to some basic internet services for free And don t have to pay in the beginning and then what we find is that you know people start using the internet and then pretty much immediately want to start paying for the full thing because they realize how valuable it is Programs like Express Wifi What I just talked about what uh what Rosemary was selling in her store You know they have a program where the first two weeks of internet are free Right So people use it and then after that they come and they buy connectivity So I think those 3 steps Spreading access lowering the cost and spreading awareness are the key things and if we do that then my hope is in the next 10 or 15 years we ll get the other half of the world that s not on the internet today on and you ll have more ideas like inaudible 00 17 55 um more people will be building stuff like that and the world is just going to be a much better place applause  Speaker 2 So the next question is a question that came in from Adefuwnke Akinola 00 18 14 and they asked how easy was it for you to move from software development to running a company So probably a question that many of you have and what sacrifices specifically did you have to make   So I m an engineer laughter All right like a lot of you guys and for me you know engineering comes down to 2 real principles Right That I think a lot of you guys are going to be able to relate to here So the first one for me is that you know you think of every problem as a system and every system can be better no matter how good or bad it is you can make anything better And that goes for whether you re writing code or you re building hardware or you re system as a company or you re working on the education system or government These things are systems and they can all be improved and kind of you have this engineering mindset s that s gone into that The second part I think about about being an engineer is that you break down problems from the biggest stage um down to smaller pieces that you can then solve So I was getting started with Facebook I was writing code Right Like a lot of you guys and your teams um probably were and are And you know writing code you re trying to build some functionality You break it down into different functions and subertines that um you hone them and you make them good and then you can call them and use them repeatedly and you re kind of building up from there Then you know you start building a team Right Then you re not writing as much code anymore So that s a probably that I gave up that I m a little sad about but um but it s actually not so different Right Because instead of writing subertines and functions that add up to an app um the pieces of what you re doing stop being functions and start being organizing a team of people who are who are hopefully really good engineers um and spreading the different work um across them really well and taking advantage of the different strengths of people there to make something that s bigger than the sum of it s parts And then you get to the point where you re running a company right A big company and it s not so different from that Right Instead of managing individuals you re managing teams Right And you know if you built it well and you have different um strong teams that kind of do their job well then it s not so different from writing code uh where you re writing different functions and subertines You know there is an elegance to writing code that I miss Right The code kind of always does what you want and people don t but um but people surprise you to the upside a lot too And but I do think that it s there s something really fundamental to this engineering mindset that I think you guys share right As developers and entrepreneurs and people are thinking about how you re going to remake the economy and the country here and the continent and really the whole world Right And you know I think if you keep your eye on that um you can solve a lot of problems that way applause  Speaker 3 Okay um so we take a question from the room Anybody who has a question please indicate  Speaker 2 Can I just say can I just say before we came I guaranteed Mark that Nigeria is a place where everyone would have their hands high with a question Do not embarrass me in front of my boss boss boss please  Speaker 3 Don t be shy Okay Introduce yourself and then ask  Speaker 5 Yeah Good day everyone   Hi  Speaker 5 I m Ado 00 22 02 My question is um when you started Facebook and you re still writing codes there s one serious aspect of uh any software which is marketing How did you handle the marketing How was it easy How did you translate from being the guy writing Facebook What strategy were you using to market Facebook at the initial time when it was inaudible 00 22 24   So what we ve always found is that getting the people who use your product and enjoy to evangelize it to their friends is by far the most effective way to market a product Now we re probably a little lucky Right Because I mean that s what our product is is communicating with your friends so it s probably a little easier than normal to take something like Facebook and give people the tools to spread it to their friends but we ve tried a lot of different things at Facebook We actually used to have um a traditional marketing team that did communications and thought about stuff like buying ads to help grow our community We still have that for other things like helping explain what the company does in different ways but we used to that for growing our customers right And our community And what we found was that this engineering mindset right we could actually make a bigger impact by having an engineering team that instead of having people work on ads and videos that they d put out into the world and try to convince people to sign up to Facebook if we had an engineering team that was focused on building products that empowered people in our community to spread Facebook to the people that they wanted to get on uh then that actually worked a lot better That s been I think actually one of the biggest secrets to Facebook working Right Because if you re building a social product you know one of the biggest features of a community like Facebook is that you re friends are there Right It s not much use if um no matter how many features we build if you want to share with your friends and your friends aren t on there and you re not connected with them Right So that was probably one of the key things that we needed to do And I think there were lessons for that in all the different businesses that you guys are thinking about building And I think having kind of an engineering style growth team uh has been really valuable thing and think about just again as a engineering problem rather than just kind of a traditional business problem I think is a really powerful way to approach the world applause  Speaker 2 So this is a question I ll wait I ll wait to get to you but there s a question that a lot of people had on the thread and that was uh what are your plans for Whatsapp and in particular what are your plans for developers on Whatsapp   Yeah so that s a good question So right now our primary priority for Whatsapp is to continue growing the community and connecting more people around the world There have a billion people now who use Whatsapp every month and there are about 5 billion people in the world who have phones and we kind of think that everyone who has a phone does text messaging Right I mean does everyone does anyone here not text message on their phone laughter inaudible 00 25 25 you work at Facebook We have to we have to talk Um it s like we need our people to use the internet All right Um laughter So all right I m glad that only one hand went up and little bit sad that it was my employee but um regardless the point stands So yeah I m sure he was joking but it s um but either way we ll talk later Um so we think of the primary thing that we need to go do for Whatsapp is not just go connect a billion people It seems like it s a big community but if you think about it it s only about 20 of the actual opportunity Right so that s got to be number 1 Right Because our long term potential for Whatsapp is going to be dependent on how big the community is Now that said we are starting to think about how people can connect to businesses through Whatsapp too And some of you guys might have seen we just did this update to our data use policy on Whatsapp last week And this was actually the primary reason why we wanted to do this was to make it so that you know let s say you re a business and you re using You have a Facebook page and maybe you re building a bot for messenger and you also want to connect with people on Whatsapp so you can kind of know who your customers are and talk to them with a unified voice across all those different services You know you figure we own these different services You should be able to do that That s a thing that we should provide to to business And that s a thing that we want to be able to do long term so you know if you re a business you should be able to you know keep track of who your customers are and communicate with them on a steady basis through Whatsapp If you re a person who s using Whatsapp uh you should be able to reach out to the businesses that you interact with to get customer support or buy things or do whatever you need That s definitely a big part of what we need to do long term but we re just at the beginning of that journey And I think for the next few years the big thing is just going to be how do we get billions of more people on the service applause  Speaker 3 So we re going to take another question from the room And uh I think you have a question   Go to you guys  Speaker 3 Hi Stand up  Speaker 6 Sure So my name is Shay I am media entrepreneur in Lagos and co founder of Big Cabal Media and I m interested in Oculus I ve used Treaty and I know a few people who have used it It s really awesome but the question is the Oculus platforms right now the price point is seem to be high and question is what are the plans to bring it to a price point that will be more accessible to people in developing markets   Yeah it s a great question so I think you re absolutely right Right now it s more expensive than we would it And there are also fewer apps than there will be in a few years right So the ecosystem is going to keep developing Right We re going to get the hardware to be less expensive and better And you know there going to be more things that you can do with it which I think will will justify for more people getting it but it could be a while Right it could be 5 10 uh 15 years until it s a really mature thing that reaches the scale that Smartphones are at today in the world And but I do think we ll get there So not just on VR but think about this for AR I m looking around and a lot of you guys are wearing glasses I wear glasses too Uh when I m not wearing contacts and I think in the future we re going to have an AR product augmented reality where you have glasses just like what you re wearing but instead of being able to see the world and have corrected vision you ll also be able to put in virtual objects in it Right So lets say uh we want to play chess I ll just be able to go All right Here s a chess board Here You move your piece You got the glasses I got mine You beat me Um we ll never speak of that again laughter Um that s going to happen Right Except the you beating me part laughter Although I don t know I don t know I m not that good at chess Um and if you think about it in the future so we ll get the price down All right So it ll be Say we get to a point where those kind of glasses cost you know 100 Right Instead of you know Oculus today The rift costs 600 You know then the One of the thing that I m really excited about is not only that that s going to start being affordable enough for a lot people to use Right About as affordable as a phone is today but think about how many things you re not going to need to buy when you have that Because think about all the things in your life today that could actually just be an app in that world Right You might own a T V Right You probably paid you know 50 100 200 for the T V In the future that ll just be a 1 app Right I mean it doesn t need to be It doesn t need to exist It doesn t need to be a physical thing Or it ll be just summing that into your glasses It s on the wall You see it and um and you can buy it for cheap All right so your glasses just paid for themselves because now you have a computer and a T V Right And it s kind of amazing when you think about it How many of the things in your life don t actually need to be physical All right so if you take out you know all the food which you know needs to be real and laughter you know the chairs and the stuff that has to support you and the tables that you put your other real stuff on You know I mean think about all the other stuff The art right The paintings Anything that s a screen Anything that s a game That s an interaction That s about information Doesn t actually need to be physical which again think about how hard it was to build that chess board Right That we talked about You know someone needed to actually physically you know carve or produce those pieces and not that many people around the world have the resource to do that but in a world in the future where a lot more people have the internet anyone going to be able to build that chessboard app that we just played that quick game on that you crushed me at And that I think is going to unlock a lot of creativity Right So you re going to get entrepreneurs all around the world building stuff that people can afford and it s going to be much cheaper than I think the ecosystem is today So that s the future that I hope we reach It s going to take a while to get there so I think we all have to patience There are not only some Not only ecosystem but also scientific breakthroughs that I think we need to make on the way there but that s what I kind of keep in my mind is where I want the world to be in 10 or 15 years And I think if we get there that s awesome right applause  Speaker 2 Okay For this next question I ll take one from the room Okay I m lazy so I ll go here If you could stand up please and tell me your name All right I ll hang on to the mic  Speaker 7 Okay Hi my name can you hear me   I can  Speaker 7 My name is inaudible 00 32 18 and I work for you And so my question is um do you find that there s need is it an assumption or do you find that there s need to actually customize current products for the emerging markets or is that an assumption that people just make without you know experience in the market first hand And how do you deal with that um   Yeah  Speaker 7 How do you address that   Yeah  Speaker 7 How do deal with that dichotomy   Yeah no that s a great question So I think you re absolutely right Right That s you know there are a bunch of different ways that we think about customizing the product All right So one is language Right Where you know the internet isn t very useful if the information that you re trying to find um isn t in a language that you know Right So one of the things that we ve done is we ve tried to spread Facebook so it s in as many languages as possible by giving our community the power to translate the service themselves Right One of the things that we re proud of is that we reach a lot of different dialects and languages around the world that no other internet service is available because of our community is the ones doing the translation Right so earlier this year I think we opened up um Hausa Right And we ve already committed to uh in the next year and a half opening in I think 10 more dialects and languages Um and you know that s an important thing if you want people to be able to use the service they need to be able to read and understand it It s not just what language the service is in it s also the content in it Right So I mean the service can be in that language but theirs not good content that people want to see in the good videos that you want to watch or uh things they want to read And that s not that useful either So a lot of what I think we need to do is work with the local entrepreneurial communities to make sure that we re building stuff And content producers in those in those languages It s one of the things that I m hoping to do while I m here is uh is visit uh Nollywood Is that what you call it laughter Um and so I think that s going to be a lot of fun If it s one of the best resources in the world uh for building content Right And and producing content Only an engineer would call it building content They would kill me for that but I don t know It s who I am Um so that I think is a big is a big part of the whole thing Right There s also a lot of technical work that I think goes into customizing the service for uh for different areas Right And that s not so much cultural work as it is that there are different kinds of infrastructure around the world All right so we want to make sure that that Facebook loads quickly for people who are on a 2G network a 3G network a really new LTE network Right And they have very different characteristics in terms of how fast things will load And we don t want to the service needs to load quickly Right I mean people don t want to use this service that s going to take half a minute to load So we have to make sure that it works on these different network conditions around the world Right And that s that s a big part of of our job too And we take all this uh really really seriously So um increasingly I think we re spending more time on kind of customizing and making sure that we get all of that we make sure that the services work really well all around the world but um it s a big part of the mission Right If you re trying to connect everyone in the world You know the community right now has 1 7 billion people but there are 7 billion people in the world so there are more than 5 billion people who we need to reach in their native language in the technology stack that they re using Yeah applause  Speaker 3 Great I think we ll take a we ll take a question from the room now See a lot of hands up front And uh yes So please tell us your name  Speaker 8 Morning Mark   Hey  Speaker 8 Pleasure to be here So my name is Tungi 00 36 07 I run the mobile living platform And what we do is we give inaudible 00 36 12 so that kids get 2 4 gig every month for a achieving their inaudible 00 36 16   That s awesome  Speaker 8 What I want to ask is a two part question First question is how do you see messenger and Whatsapp evolving   Uh huh  Speaker 8 Are you going to allow them to evolve separately And secondly I have inaudible 00 36 31 for not taking me along to the page for you foundation so how do I get to pitch to you to invest in our program Thank you    laughter That s the spirit laughter That s what I m talking about applause All right Um we ll make sure we get your email after this So all right uh I respect that All right so messenger and Whatsapp Here s what we re going to do You know they re actually different they re different communities and different products and the strategy is not to combine them over time but to have each play to their strength So if you think about Whatsapp is really a text messaging replacement Right And it s faster uh it s more reliable You could do groups better than texting and that s I think why a lot of people are using it And it s more affordable in a lot of places So anyone who you text whether it s someone who is you closest friend or your family down to someone who has a store that you want to buy something from Um you know people feel comfortable and use Whatsapp to text those people Now messenger is kind of a different community Right Messenger is all about today at least your Facebook friends So you re probably a little bit less likely to be friends with you know that guy who owns the store Um to message them on Facebook messenger So maybe we ll get there eventually but we re not there yet And similarly you re probably more likely to have uh in your Facebook friends somebody you went to college with or high school with who maybe you re not as close with today or is maybe you don t have their current phone number Right Uh and you re not connecting with them on Whatsapp but when it s their birthday and you want to reach out and say hi or see how they re doing um you hit them on Facebook Messenger And the styles are pretty different too So Whatsapp is really focused on a being a utility Right So fast simple not a lot of frills Messenger is very focused on expression More fun different kinds of formats um different kind of stuff like that So we think that the right strategy over time is not to combine them but to have each play to their strengths Both services have more than a billion people using them Uh like we talked about before There I think there are 5 billion people in the world who text today so um we have a lot of work to do And we ll talk later laughter applause  Speaker 2 Okay   That only works for the first person who does it laughter  Speaker 2 No more pitch questions Okay So I m going to ask you this question up here because I think it s a question that s near and dear to everyone because we got so many of them   All right  Speaker 2 So that s it s a really it s a really difficult question so get yourself prepped Okay Schiama 00 39 16 posted this but many many other people did Have you had time to try any Nigerian food laughter Specifically she recommended pounded yam inaudible 00 39 28 roasted goat meat   All right Well  Speaker 2 Washed down with palm wine   You can stay up here for this one because you know the answer So you know last night I got into Lagos and I m talking to our team All right so inaudible 00 39 44 um Amecca 00 39 44 and we re um we re sitting down to get food I m like All right I want to I want to have traditional Nigerian food Right So they start You show up and you have a ton of different things Right So the inaudible 00 40 03 rice and shrimp Delicious Delicious Um the pounded yam just kind of Emay 00 40 12 tells me you got to do it with one hand I m like All right Come on I just got here I just got here Give me two hands to make the spoon with yam Get into the soup  Speaker 2 Can I interrupt to say expert So after one or two one handed he even had tied his inaudible 00 40 30 and put it over the side like that and scooping expertise   So I m eating the soup and I reach in and I pull out a piece of meat I m like All right This is goat This is awesome But then there s another thing So I m like All right So what s that And Emay and inaudible 00 40 53 kind of look at each other My two um you know American born Nigerian friends here and they look at each other like What have we done Because it s snail laughter and they give me this look like this is a mistake because we don t eat this Now I want to give Amecca a shout out because he does And um I m like Look All right guys I don t come to Nigeria often We re eating the snail applause  Speaker 2 Well done   So Emay and inaudible 00 41 33 are like All right I guess we can try this Um what you don t eat snail It was delicious It was good I love it That s one of my favorite parts of going to new countries is um is getting to learn about the culture and eating the food I really appreciate you guys sharing that with me It was a it was a very it was a fun experience um and I was told not to compare the inaudible 00 42 02 rice with that of other neighboring countries So I think we ll just stop it there  Speaker 2 I think we can stop there   It was a good experience It was a good experience Thank you  Speaker 2 That s great Thank you  Speaker 3 Okay Yes snail good I can testify   Absolutely  Speaker 3 So we ll take a question from the room and uh think Vincent you have a question  Speaker 9 Yeah Thank you very much Uh my name is Vincent inaudible 00 42 34 I m founder of inaudible 00 42 38 And my question is this Um first because you re doing a lot of great job I see myself as one of the biggest fan but um what um steps are the team taking to make Facebook also serve as a learning resource linear platform where businesses and entrepreneurs can resort to to um to get training material for professional skills Thank you very much   Yeah those are great questions Something we care a lot about Both at Facebook and at uh my philanthropy foundation the Chen Zuckerberg Initiative Facebook we re doing a bunch of things right So one is we have this FB Start Program which is It s a little bit less of a training and more just about equipping entrepreneurs and developers uh with the tools that they need uh to to kind of get started on their own I think a lot of you guys are probably pretty familiar with this In terms of education um you know I m pretty interested in a few different things One is personalized learning So giving everyone in the world the skills the tools that they need to learn at the pace that they want Right So let s say you you you get math really easily so can get ahead really quickly and get really advanced but when it comes to history it takes you a little longer Right You should be able to learn at your own pace and learn with the materials that help you the best right So some people learn better by you know watching a video or working with their partners or by talking to someone or doing practice problems You should be able to do whatever you want uh and one of the things that we re doing is building software that gives people the power and gives teachers the power to give that kind of personalized learning experience to all their students And we re live with that uh in more than a hundred schools in the U S So I m excited about that And um across the continent here the Chen Zuckerberg Initiative has actually made 2 investments that I m really proud of So the first is Andela Uh which is basically it s this training program where people can join and apply uh even if they don t have any um any engineering experience at all We re in the basic the premise of Andela is that talent is evenly distributed around the world and just because someone hasn t had the opportunity to learn engineering it doesn t mean that they re not going to be a great engineer and the Andela folks have basically built um this program to take you in a month or two from being maybe not even knowing anything about engineering to being a professional engineer who can work with large companies around the world on highly effective teams That is something that I m really excited about because that s going to scale and I think train tens of thousands of engineers here on the continent I mean they have 2 big centers here in Lagos and others around the continent but that s one that I m pretty excited about Another one that we invest in is called Bridge International Academy That s more of a primary school and the idea there is the founders thought that they could build a better school for the same cost as going to a public school Right So even though public school s supposed to be free you still need to buy the textbooks and need to buy the uniform and all this stuff They founders kind of came up with this idea that if for the same amount of cost that it took to do that to go to a public school if they could build a private school that performed a lot better then that could be something that can spread all over the world And they started it in Kenya And now have hundreds of different schools with tens of thousands of students including now in Nigeria and Uganda as well And um it s a really inspiring model I think It s a great testament to the kind of work and entrepreneurship um that s happening here on the continent and I m looking forward to doing more investing here and I think there s a lot more stuff like this that s going to make sure that opportunity ends up being uh as equally distributed as talent is around the world applause  Speaker 2 Okay Hands up I ll take another question from the room See Wait Hang on Hang on Okay You guys are going to make me walk I see   I m not sure she s ever going to get to the front  Speaker 2  laughter Wait Is there one all the way up here Uh okay Sorry   Tough decisions  Speaker 2 I m going to go up here Okay Can you come this way though   We can get to both laughter  Speaker 2 I m going to hang on to the mic  Speaker 10 Okay  Speaker 2 Don t make me fight you  Speaker 10 First of all thank you for making Nigeria your first port of call applause My name is Amechi Akobe 00 47 35 and I work at a bank Access bank You essentially predicted the future many years ago with Facebook What do you see happening ten years from now Part A Part B How does Mark want to be remembered That s it laughter Thank you   So one of my favorite technology quotes is that the best way to predict the future is to create it so I think the future can actually go in a lot of different directions right And I think what gets made is not necessarily a foregone conclusion Right There s um there s a one of my other favorite sayings is that it s much easier to predict what s going to happen in the world 20 or 25 years in the future than to predict what s going to happen 5 years in the future and the reason for that is that you know there might be some big themes that play out over 20 30 40 years but you know how they happen You know what mix of products and services get built and who builds them and where they come from is not I don t think that that s written ahead of time So um you know the mission that I care about at Facebook is still very much the same as in the beginning Right It s just that in the beginning I didn t think that we were going to do it Where as now I think we might When I was getting started here in college when you re a college student you don t You can talk about connecting the whole world but you don t actually think about stuff like spreading internet to people who don t have it Right I mean you re a college student You re happy if some people on the internet use your service Right It s um So But now you know here we are 10 or 12 years later and we our past you know more than a billion people using the service Almost 2 billion and we built a company that s pretty successful at this point and that we make enough money so we can actually make long term investments in things like connectivity where we can invest billions of dollars in advance that may not be profitable for us for 10 15 20 years down the road but we know are the right things Right I mean we know that everyone needs connectivity It s not the only thing they need but it s That that empowers entrepreneurs and people to connect and um and I think that through those investments that um that we re making in partnership with non profits and mobile operators and governments around the world Um I think that this dream of actually getting every person uh in the world connected is possible within within our generation within our lifetime And you know I think that that s You know there are a lot of different There are a lot of opportunities in the world and there also a lot of problems that I think would be solved by people just having more empathy and understanding more about what s going on in the lives of other people And I hope that as we as a community are able to spread connectivity that um that we can as a community help take on some of those problems And you know if we do that I will feel very good about my life applause  Speaker 3 All right Um so we have a question from Peter who s not here And it s very important question Mark So it asks What is Facebook s plan for media news and publishing platforms in Nigeria who are currently going through the transformation from newsprint to online   Yeah so you know one of the big things that I think we need to do to help connect everyone is make sure that there s good content representing all cultures and all languages I was We were talking about this a little bit ago how you know the internet in order for it to be useful you need to have content the you understand and what to interact with and that is not just you know your friends sharing stuff although I think that that s a really important part of it but also um news things that you want to learn about and read and movies and videos and entertainment content So you know one of the things that I m the most excited about for my trip to Lagos is going to check out Nollywood Right Because I think it really is a from everything that I ve heard and I hope I m not I m not just disproven on this but it um it really sounds like a national treasure and you know I think the ability to produce content that is video that is moving and emotional that transcends boundaries and I think will help tell you know a story that s not just entertaining and interesting to people who live here but tells the story of the amazing innovation and entrepreneurship and engineering and culture that is is going on here to the whole world And I do believe after being here for even a short period of time you can you know the energy there is no way that this place doesn t end up shaping uh the way that things get built around the world applause And I think that once once people appreciate that then um then I think the whole world s going to be better off so I m looking forward to that applause  Speaker 2 So I m going to take another question from the room A very very good one You ma am Can you come this way though Yes Yeah you So say your name where you re from ask your question  Speaker 11 Okay Good   I can come up here and shake your hand Speaker 11 Oh wow Yay   Plus the perks of being near the front inaudible 00 53 31 might get up here very often but when she does you get a handshake laughter  Speaker 11 Great Hello Mark Uh my name is inaudible 00 53 39 I m the founder of the inaudible 00 53 42 a media tech company based in Lagos So Mark you started Facebook over a decade ago A bunch of people started start ups around that time Today we all know the success that Facebook has attained If you had to name one thing that was the game changer for you that you did differently what would that be   Hmm So I think when you re building when you re an entrepreneur I think one of the most important things is just staying focused on learning as much as you can Because you never know as much as you need to in the beginning No matter what Right This was especially true for me I started I was 19 right I was a college student I didn t know anything about business I d never build an engineering system at large scale There was all this stuff that I didn t know so the only way that we were going to succeed was if if I focused not on what I thought I knew uh but just making sure that I learned everything else as quickly as possible You know the secret here is that learning is a process where you try things and you fail And you know I think a lot of times people ask questions like What s the biggest mistake that you made and how can you avoid that And actually I don t think that s the point Right You shouldn t be afraid of failure you should fail and learn from it and just make sure that you re doing what you can to learn as quickly as possible Um and I do think that s that why Facebook has been able to evolve so much right It started off as a service for college students that was basically just profiles that was mostly text Didn t have news feed That came a couple years in Now you know there s news feed It s made this transition from text to photos now to being more and more videos It s made the transition from colleges to uh to everyone around the world It s made the transition from PC to mobile and you know you only do that if you re really focused on learning Right And I think a lot of times people think that these things are a straight line but the best entrepreneurs and the best organizations that I ve seen are just obsessively focused on learning as much as they can every every day And you know I think you guys know this I mean as engineers and entrepreneurs and developers you don t have the success that you re having without you know making mistakes along the way and and without rebounding from them and that takes a certain persistence and mindset that you re going to get it done That s what I see here but I think if you just stay focused on that um you succeed applause  Speaker 3 Great So we ll take uh another question from the room Uh I feel so powerful right now laughter okay so   The power to disappoint so many people  Speaker 12 Sorry Um my name is inaudible 00 56 45 I m a developer turned entrepreneur Um congratulations you recently became a parent   Thank you  Speaker 12 Um I m a parent too   Congratulations to you  Speaker 12 My daughter is uh graduate of the CC Hope   Awesome  Speaker 12 She s been there for 2 years She didn t go this year This year she started building websites My question is really is that Facebook is a really individualistic um platform What are you going to do if you re trying to connect the whole world to integrate families   Well you know a lot of what I think is most powerful about Facebook is that it give people the power to stay connected no matter where they are Where it s some of the most touching stories that I hear um and one of the awesome things about being me is I get to walk down the street and people just interrupt me and tell me stories about what they re how they re using Facebook which is which is really really touching Right I mean I ll just be walking down the street in some city and someone will say Hey you know I met my wife on Facebook and now we have this child And it s like Holy crap Right laughter I mean it s like you re talking about integrating families I mean it s like all right I feel pretty good Um applause You know and people will write in with stories about how they have a twin who was separated at birth Or you know an adoptive parent who um who they haven t been connected to in a while who they found on Facebook I mean this s3tuff is just it s so heartwarming Right You re just like All right This is awesome This is what connecting the world is all about But for me it s more day to day Right My sister who lives on the other side of the country from me Where I live in California She lives in New York Um I wouldn t get to hear from her as often as I would want I wouldn t get to see what s going on with her sons right Unless she was posting photos on Facebook and in our family group You know I see a lot more that way than I do from you know when I occasionally make it out to New York or she makes it out to California You know right now you know I m here and I love being here but I miss my daughter Right And but being able to get photos sent to me you know from Priscilla s mother who s with her Um you know and even videos of her swinging on a swing It s like I mean that like makes my day Right And so I think that that is the power of connectivity I think You know we always prefer being face to face with the people we care about but when you can t be you need tools to help you do that and if we can help build some of those tools and make it so the world feels just a bit smaller and that we can make those connections and help people build families then at the end of the day that s something that we re really proud of And you know I think is a really important part of the story of what s going on on the internet applause  Speaker 2  01 00 20 Okay I hate to disappoint you but I m going to ask one that came in from the thread and it is very relevant to what you were just talking about so asked what is your current diaper changing speed record and have you ever been challenged to diaper changing duel yet And did you win   All right So there are number of questions in there laughter First one Speed record Well you know you re going to have to divide that up Right If it s pee or not pee then it s a stickier situation literally Um I think I m probably sub 20 seconds on the pee So you know I m feeling pretty good I haven t been challenged to a duel but you know being pretty competitive You know as you saw earlier with the imaginary chess match where I got really way too upset when I lost a chess match that didn t actually happen laughter I have a feeling that if there were a diaper changing duel I d be pretty competitive Um what was the last question in there  Speaker 2 The last question was have have you been challenged and did you win   All right So no and I don t know I guess we d have to see But I like my odds  Speaker 2 Can I just add an add on So you re saying you re so great at changing diapers obviously I have my doubts having many of my own but I m curious do you have tipsparticularly for those of us who have not those of us Those of you all who have not started changing diapers Are there tips that you would like to pass along   Yeah Yeah So you know here s the secret All right That I wish someone told me first You got to slide the new diaper in laughter Before you take the old one off applause You know I see all the parents You guys know what I m talking about I mean because then it s really going to slow you down Right I mean you go from a routing diaper change to a whole outfit change real quick  Speaker 3 All right So we ll take one more from the room We ll give the front some love   All right Here we go  Speaker 3 Okay Okay Okay So let s land here   Good to meet you  Speaker 13 Great Oh can I hug you Please   All right Sure Absolutely 01 02 46  Speaker 13 Fantastic I m so happy to meet you Um and I just want to say generally for Nigerians we re not excited by anybody so if I saw Michael Jackson I d be like Hi  Speaker 2 Even now that he s dead You wouldn t be laughter  Speaker 13 I d be like Hi Seriously I d be like Hi So two things can you please tell Cheryl Sandberg that she is our hero here I mean some of us anyway and we re dying to meet her See if she will come That would be amazing applause   She is a hero  Speaker 13 Yeah she is amazing Um so just so that we re not all on PC um we ve been PC so far U just wanted to say something that sort of like really bothered some of us here   Uh huh  Speaker 13 So when you chose to launch in South Africa we were really disappointed because um it sort of feels like um people think of South Africa as the really the core of Africa and it s not I mean it s part of us I m so sorry South Africans I apologize  Speaker 2 Shots fired Shots fired  Speaker 13 I m sorry South Africans but it s not 01 03 50   It s like we re not saying our is better  Speaker 13 It s not it s not even third world You know And so really we sort of think you ve Facebook has missed a lot of opportunities on the continent and I wanted for you to think about how you could address them I think that your staff are doing phenomenal but they re really understaffed and I wanted to know your ideas for African inaudible 01 04 15 and Nigeria applause   I think you re right Although you know when you re building something you know I think you can I try not to think of things as missed opportunities as much as things that we just haven t done yet Right Um so there s certainly a lot more that we need to do Right So here in Nigeria you know there are I think it s 18 million people use Facebook Right So that s there s a lot more to go right I think a little fewer than that use Whatsapp There s a lot more to go there Right That s the biggest country on the continent for us Um so you know part of the reason why I m here now um although this trip is primarily focused on entrepreneurship and developers is that this is where I think a lot of the future is going to get built Right And applause so you know I think you have to hopefully have patience with us Right Because I think um we re not going to build it Right You guys are and we um we want to do our part We want to help invest in connectivity and help connect everyone here um and if I m back in a few years or five years and we haven t made a lot more progress I m going to be pretty disappointed but I think we re the beginning of this journey And um but I think the key thing that I think a lot of you guys get so clearly is that you know connectivity the economy here it isn t fundamentally going to be built by by companies like Facebook Right We can We have a service that we can provide and we can empower people here and we re proud of the role that we can play but the reason why I wanted to be with you guys here today is that you re building this And I think that that s the key thing and um I don t know The more that we can do to help empower folks here to build the future that s the better that we can do Now does that mean we re going to have to invest more in the future Of course we will We will We need to We need to do more Um and my hope is the next time I m here um we ll we ll be a lot further along on that with a lot more than 18 million people in the community here and across the continent but you know 18 million s not a bad start Um it s actually pretty good laughter Pretty good Um but applause So we ll So thank you  Speaker 2 Okay so I m going to take one from the room Just going to let everyone know this is the last question So this question must be an incredibly great question Do not embarrass me Make it amazing Make it full of insight Uh I will pick you Is it amazing  Speaker 14 I hope so  Speaker 2 Okay Come on  Speaker 14 Hi My name is inaudible 01 07 34 and I run a IT service company called Future Soft We offer social media management services to our clients so you just said 18 million people are on Facebook so from a business perspective and for getting small and medium size business on to Facebook at the moment there is somewhat a barrier to entry Right Especially with the current naira to dollar rate because as a business you kind of need to have spend in order to actually grow your community   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 14 On Facebook So how can you you know guys actually lower that barrier to entry to get more businesses onto Facebook because they will bring more people on to Facebook as well Um and I m guessing Instagram is going the same route   Yeah  Speaker 14 That Facebook is going and at the moment conversion rates that we re seeing on Instagram are incredibly higher than on Facebook because it s not you don t have to pay for it right So once it gets paid that will down and it will have an immense impact on small and medium size businesses   Yeah  Speaker 14 If that actually happens so   Yeah  Speaker 14 How can you guys help us to get more SMEs on to Facebook and Instagram um to actually help you guys grow the community because I think it s going to be driven from those small or medium size   Yeah  Speaker 14 Businesses Thank you   Great question Before you sit down I got to shake your hand Thank you  Speaker 14 Thanks   So you know this is a good question Right And growing small businesses I think is a is a really important part of all these communities and one of the things that we re most proud of at Facebook is that 60 million businesses have pages across the world There s nothing like that that s ever happened in the history of the world Where 60 million businesses use some platform for free to reach their customers Right So that s something that you know a big part of our mission is giving folks who are just getting started the same tools that traditionally only bigger companies would have had access to Right So there was a time when you know you had to you know only a bigger company could build an app and get on the phone and now you know anyone be in the most used app right in news feed if people connect with you You know there was a time when only uh big companies could afford to do the kind of analytics that now is free Right On these services I think one of the big things that it levels the playing field and makes it so that talented people anywhere can build You know as you re saying you know when a page gets started in a community you get free distribution right So as you re growing people connect and they you don t have to pay to reach them Um once a community gets bigger and there s more competition for what s in news feed because people have a lot more friends and they re connected to a lot more businesses then you either need to produce better content right To earn it s spot in news feed or pay Um but by that time hopefully if you re in at the ground floor um you ve kind of built up that community and have and have your reach Um you know I m going to talk about something else besides pages as well which is what we re doing with developers to help give tools to help get off the ground And one of the big things that we re really proud of the part that we can play is FB Start Right Where basically we go around the world and we work with developers in all these different cities to give them access to free tools uh sorry we give them free access to tools that would otherwise cost money um to help grow their business and get started So it s everything from you know thousands of dollars of ad credits so that way if you want to advertise to get your page content into news feed you can and you know you re building a inaudible 01 11 26 and you re doing inaudible 01 11 28 start so you don t actually you re not paying for that You re getting those ad credits for free Um to things like getting free cloud infrastructure Right Through our partnership with Amazon Right I mean that s you know the infrastructure s a big cost of building a new service and you know one of the things that we want to do is reduce those barriers to getting started so that way anyone who s talented who has an idea who has the grit who wants to push through and try to build something can get that started What I found from my experience the hardest thing is getting to that initial product market fit Right So you can do that in a dorm room Right I mean by time that I left Harvard um we already had you know tens of thousands of people using Facebook and didn t cost a whole lot to run I was renting servers I think for 89 a month or something like that I was paying for banner ads that we had on the side of the site Um and then once we d shown that it was going to work and it was going to scale then there s a lot of investment and people want are going to chase after the next idea once you ve proven that that s going to work So a lot of what we re trying to do work with pages and with FB Start is giving people the tools to get off the ground um and get that product market fits that you can kind of show to the world what you re going to build and then you kind of scale it and take it from there But it s a great question I think it s I think the perfect way to end this session today which you know I ve wanted to focus on developers and entrepreneurs that s why I m here You know we re broadcasting this live on Facebook now so people all around the world um are watching this which I think is important because I think people around the world need to see this Right I mean they need to see how much energy there is here applause Um and how good and strong the community is You guys are all doing awesome work It s an honor for me to be here Thank you so much and I m looking forward to meeting you guys for the rest of the day  Speaker 2 Thank you applause   Thank you applause  Speaker 2 If everyone could stay in their seats '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2016-032', 'content': '  On News Feed s 10th birthday I want to share some thoughts on the idea of a social feed and how it s changed the way we see the world In many ways social media is the most diverse form of media that has ever existed Before the internet most people got their news from only a handful of newspapers TV and radio stations Different outlets made different editorial decisions and it was easy to pick one you liked and stick with it Now that s changing A study by the Pew Research Center this year showed that more than seven in ten adults get their news on mobile and two out of three say family and friends are an important way they get news including through social media That means more people are getting exposed to a larger and more diverse set of opinions One of the things we re really proud of at Facebook is that whatever your political views you probably have some friends who are in the other camp You probably have some friends who practice different religions or who come from different countries In Europe for example the average person on Facebook has more than 50 friends from outside their own country That means whatever TV station you might watch or whatever newspaper you might read on Facebook you re hearing from a broader set of people than you would have otherwise Last year the American Press Institute found that seven out of ten millennials the group that s most likely to get their news online said their social media feeds contained a mix of viewpoints similar to and different from their own And three out of four said they investigated different opinions at least some of the time It s not a perfect system Research shows that we all have psychological bias that makes us tune out information that doesn t fit with our model of the world It s human nature to gravitate towards people who think like we do But even if the majority of our friends have opinions similar to our own with News Feed we have easier access to more news sources than we did before Still we can help by doing a better job filtering out false information or clickbait We ve made some changes to the News Feed algorithm and we re constantly trying to get a better understanding of what our community finds valuable and what it doesn t I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make Facebook a place for all ideas Some of what we re up against is human nature biases that existed long before the internet But by giving people access to more information and helping promote diversity and a plurality of opinions we can build stronger communities I m interested to hear what you think about these issues Leave your comments below or like your favorites and I ll respond to as many as I can '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2016-042', 'content': '  Can we cure all diseases in our children s lifetime When our daughter was born we wrote a letter about the hope she gave us for the future It s a hope I know so many of us feel that we can make a better future for our children and generations to come I m an engineer and I think this hope is part of the engineering mindset It s the belief that you can take any system and make it much better whether it s code hardware biology a company an education system a government anything We look for ways to bring engineering to social change That s what we ve done at Facebook to build a community of more than 1 7 billion people That s what we ve done with Internet org to help local entrepreneurs connect more than 30 million people to the internet That s what we re doing with personalized learning to help teachers bring these tools to more than 100 schools And that s how we hope to help scientists as well Priscilla and I have spent the last few years talking to dozens of top scientists and experts who believe it s possible to cure prevent or manage all diseases by the end of this century That doesn t mean no one will ever get sick but it does that mean that we ll get sick a lot less and that when we do we ll always be able to identify and treat the problem or at least manage it as a non harmful condition Medicine has only been a modern science for about a century and we ve already made incredible progress Think about that For thousands of years we made very little progress Then we started applying the scientific method to investigating diseases and progress really took off Since then we ve eradicated smallpox and are close to eradicating polio We can prevent meningitis measles and many forms of influenza with vaccines We discovered antibiotics to treat potentially deadly infections like tuberculosis and pneumonia We produced insulin to manage diabetes statins to reduce heart disease and chemotherapies to treat cancer We ve reduced smoking through public education We ve even found ways to reduce life threatening diseases like HIV to conditions we can manage Over the last century life expectancy has increased by 1 4 year each year driven by advances in science and public health If this trend only continues then at the end of the century our average life expectancy will be around 100 This trend implies we will have cured the diseases that prevent most people from reaching that age today As technology accelerates I m optimistic we can do even better Today most people die from four kinds of diseases heart disease 10 8 million 19 2 cancer 8 2 million 14 6 infectious disease 8 5 million 15 1 and neurological disease like stroke 6 8 million 12 1 Of the rest almost half are due to accidents and injuries 5 8 million 10 3 or otherwise unrelated to disease 3 1 million 5 5 This gives us an idea of where to focus to start I don t want to oversimplify the problem Each category has many different conditions and areas to study For example every cancer is a different disease It is unlikely each category can be addresses by a single breakthrough But for each category there are common strategies for addressing those diseases and common tools and technology we can develop to better understand and fight them more effectively Throughout the history of science most scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by the invention of new tools that help us see and experiment in new ways The telescope let us see the planets and stars which enabled us to learn about astronomy and the universe The microscope let us see cells and bacteria which enabled us to identify and treat diseases like malaria and pneumonia DNA sequencing and now editing let us understand our genomes to help us precisely fight cancers and genetic disorders Tools also create breakthroughs in how we treat diseases Vaccines are a broadly applicable tool that we can now reuse and build upon to prevent more and more diseases It s easy to imagine modern tools that could unlock progress in each of the four major disease categories today AI software to interpret brain imaging or datasets of cancer genomes a chip to diagnose any infectious disease continuous bloodstream monitoring to identify diseases early and maps of all the different cell types and states to help design drugs to combat any given disease Focusing on tools suggests a roadmap to help cure prevent and manage all diseases If we can help develop new tools to see each of the major disease categories in new ways then we can enable scientists around the world to make breakthroughs in those diseases faster Building tools will require new ways of organizing and funding science Most science funding today is small grants less than a few hundred thousands of dollars This may help pay for scientists salaries or part of a lab but it s not enough to do major tool development Tool development often requires groups of scientists and engineers working together over long periods of time For example the internal combustion engine was developed by scientists and engineers over decades Eventually this tool unlocked many inventions including cars and aircraft But it took a big investment large scale collaboration and a long time horizon That brings us to our plan We re going to focus on bringing scientists and engineers together to build new tools that can empower the whole scientific community to make breakthroughs on the four major disease categories Solving large problems requires finding new ways for scientists and engineers to work together share data and coordinate Most science funding today goes towards individuals working separately so there is an open opportunity to fund larger efforts Engineering has always been key to tool development Today this increasingly means software engineering But the current structure of scientific grants does not encourage big scientific efforts with world class engineers teams like the ones you d find at great technology companies This is required for developing many modern tools so this will be our focus We will also push for more science funding Today our society spends 50 times more treating people who are sick than we invest in finding cures so people don t get sick in the first place You d only invest this way if you believed people would always suffer from disease In that case you d do the best you could treating people and hope science improves health at the margin That s what investing 50 times more in treating people than in curing disease looks like But in a world where we can actually cure all disease in our children s lifetime we should invest dramatically more in this opportunity There are many opportunities for governments non profits and companies to invest more in curing diseases and in developing tools to empower the whole scientific community This is an area where public support matters The more people believe we can cure all disease in our children s lifetimes the more likely the government is to invest in it and the more likely we are to achieve this goal This is a place where we need your help and we can all make a difference together After years of learning about these problems talking to top scientists and experts reading everything we could get our hands on and getting into the math of how science is funded we are optimistic that it is possible to cure prevent or manage all disease in our children s lifetime If we can bring scientists and engineers together to build the right tools then we can accelerate breakthroughs on the major diseases and we can continue until there are no more left Remember this is a long term effort We plan to invest billions of dollars over decades It will take years for the first tools to be developed and then years after that before they are used to cure diseases This is hard and we need to be patient but it s important This is about the future we want for our daughter and children everywhere If there s a chance that we can help cure all diseases in our children s lifetimes then we will do our part Together we all have a real shot at leaving the world a better place for our children than we found it '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2016-057', 'content': ' Speaker 1 Come up but basically you know at that time Facebook had nine million members and now Facebook is approaching two billion members so all users as   All right  Speaker 1 On Facebook Hey   Hey  Speaker 1 Thank you   Good to see you  Speaker 1 Please   Hey  Speaker 1 I was I was just saying Mark that when I met you Facebook had nine million users and now it has close the two billion so things have changed slightly   It s been a busy decade 00 00 30  Speaker 1 And I wrote a book in the interim called the Facebook Effect um but thank you so much for being here um   Glad to  Speaker 1 There are so many things to talk to you about it s almost you know beyond belief and I ve tried to limit them but I want to start given that we are in this bizarre moment in history with an election having just happened asking you how do you respond to the fact that Donald Trump has just been elected president of United States What do you think it means 00 01 00    00 01 30 Well we have a lot of work to do but you know that would have been true either way You know I don t want to downplay the impact of this because elections have serious consequences for um for everyone in the country and probably around the world so you know there are a lot of people who are pretty happy about the result and there are a lot of people who uh who who are upset but one thing that I think it s easier to lose track of is that you know most progress I think is made by private citizens  00 02 00 Right It s made and and there a lot of people all around the world right Who aren t in the US Uh there are a lot of people who are not part of the government There are companies that are pushing stuff forward There is technology and infrastructure that is getting built up overtime more and more and that progress will continue and I I think that that s been a theme of this conference Uh that is certainly how how I think about it Right and a lot of the long term things that that I care about around improving education right and curing diseases and connecting people developing AI that can uh not only make Facebook better but can save people s lives and building the next computing platform in VR These are all things that uh that I think we are going to be able to keep on pushing forward and and making progress on We ve been working on a lot of them for a while and often you know 00 02 30 not with the government although you know sometimes partnership can be helpful there and um and and I think you know those those are the things that we are working on I think the things that are working on are going to keep on making progress too So I I don t want to downplay this I mean this this elections there is a reason why they they get so much coverage is that they they make a real difference in the world but uh but I also think it would not be right to suggest that it changes the fundamental arch of of um technology or progress or or anything like that overtime which hopefully should be if you if you are a Trump supporter you 00 03 00 if you do not need heartening and if you aren t then um then hopefully that can make a little bit optimistic about the progress that we continue making  Speaker 1 Well that was a very good of turning that question into a really good general opening statement uh without being too committal on the the election outcome which is politicking given your role and I don t blame you for that Um but one of the questions I had you know Facebook is such a data driven company You guys are always all over the data and one of the things I was wondering since 00 03 30 no one saw this coming is what is widely said even the Trump campaigns itself thought they were going to lose Did you have any inklings based on the data that you have that this might be the outcome   Not really I mean you know one of the things that I think you learn by building these systems is that you the systems are very specifically designed to um to understand something and do a specific things So we designed News Feed to try to show people the content that s going to be the most meaningful 00 04 00 and interesting to them right We designed systems like People You May Know to help people connect with the people they are going to care about so there is not really a way that a company like ours would just happen to know something like that right In order to to to know that you would have go specifically dig into it  Speaker 1 But you can measure the number of Trump related user crosstalk 00 04 25 and the 00 04 30 relative enthusiasm could be measured I could imagine ways that you could figure it   Well we could do that but also anyone else could I mean I can rattle some stuff off the top of my head here and I think you know it s not a surprise that um or not not news that Trump has more followers on on Facebook than Hillary does Um I think some of his posts got more engagement I mean anyone could could have looked this uh before Um and and I think some of those themes uh you saw in other elections around the world as well  Speaker 1 Yeah that s true   Right so so recently 00 05 00  Speaker 1 Although you got a lot more data than the public is available than is available to the public about what s happening under the covers at Facebook I mean that that s that s well we can I want to talk a little more about the News Feed because you know one of the things that really is extraordinarily changed from when we first met and even when I re reported on my book and spent a lot of time talking to you which was seven and eight years ago um is that Facebook 00 05 30 has really become effectively the primary source of information and flow of news and information to a very large percentage of the American public and the public in the world the population of the planet So the News Feed is this enormously influential vehicle for the transmission of information so how do you think about what it is today and where it s going and what the responsibilities are that you have as a result of that enormous influence that it has    00 06 00 So News Feed is probably the most important product at at Facebook Right As you know it actually wasn t a part of the product in launch until about couple of years in I think we we first met uh right when the first protest was happening around News Feed We had about a million people who were using Facebook at the time and 100 000 people actually protested it when we when we started it so it got off to uh inauspicious start It has grown to into something that more than a billion people look at every day and use it to 00 06 30 primarily connect with friends and family I mean there is a lot said about the role of of news and news content and that s an important but that isn t most of what people are doing on Facebook most of it is connecting with friends and family You know the way that we think about News Feed is our job and and our goal is to uh help people see the is to help give people the most the content that is going to be most meaningful and interesting 00 07 00 to them right There is always a way to make the system smarter and better So I let me take you through a brief history of the product because I think it s it s uh pretty interesting You know early versions of News Feed we ve had different versions of ranking since early on but we ve actually we we played around with a version for a while that wasn t ranked It was just chronological and what we found was that didn t provide the best experience for people because you know we d get these reports where someone said You know my cousin 00 07 30 uh just gave birth and they posted a photo of of their baby and and I missed it because that happened five hours ago and News Feed was chronological and all these less important updates were at the top That was a bummer right So then we realized okay ranking really is better right And and all of the  Speaker 1 You have to make judgments   Reflect that So we started off with uh ranking that was largely based on the the simplest engagement signals that we have in our systems so how many likes does a post get How many comments or shares or uh how much do people click on them or read 00 08 00 a a news item and that that improved things a lot Right And that was much better than chronological right in terms of delivering a high quality experience right because you know a post of something that s important in someone life is typically going to get more engagement so we we know to show that more prominently That s not perfect either right Because there are all these things like clickbait for example that might kind of get people to click on them but then they don t feel good afterwards 00 08 30 right And so we ve actually moved away from that model of having News Feed be ranked primarily based on those in product engagement signals to now we have this News Feed quality panel where we we actually have thousands of people who uh come in and we we show them News Feed stories and we ask them to rank them themselves right So that way we have a sense of of what uh what sort of a ground truth quality is that that people care about  00 09 00 As time goes on we are always trying to incorporate more and more signals into the mix right So um take something like clickbait which we ve been pretty actively trying to fight um getting a sense from people directly as to what kind of stories they think are clickbaits that way we can show people more of what s meaningful to them has dramatically improved the quality right And I would imagine that there are probably a number of signals that we can add going forward I think that there will always be more then I view that as our job to have the the fullest 00 09 30 idea of how people actually value the different content and what people find meaningful and important in their lives As a matter of fact one of the things that we ask is not just um how you rank stories in your News Feed but of of the five most meaningful things that you saw in any media today um how would you rank the things that you are seeing in your News Feed based uh uh versus some of the other things right because we want to make sure not only are we getting the items that are on Facebook right but that we are actually showing people the things that are going to be most meaningful to them So so it s it s a big thing there s but there s a lot more improvement that I think 00 10 00 we can make and that s why uh you know you shouldn t be surprised when you see us continuing to uh improve the the algorithm and make changes there  Speaker 1 Aren t there thousands and thousands of parameters in the algorithm I mean   Yeah  Speaker 1 That all intersect with one another and you know that there is a very complex set of calculations that are being made for each individual right   Yeah it s and it s a modern AI problem right So and one of the one of the things that you know the News Feed ranking is an AI and what one of the things that that allows it to do is to consider many more factors than than a person looking at might be able to 00 10 30 but you basically you take the signals that people tell us that they want to see in News Feed and you you bake that in and that s the ground truth for quality for for a feed  Speaker 1 Well you know one of the things post election you ve been getting a lot of push back from people who feel that you distorted the way that people perceived the information during the course of the campaign either because 00 11 00 of a filter bubble effect or because you didn t filter out enough fake stories that might have been published simply to gain traction and sell advertising and might have been uh distortive of people s information that they that they perceived and and and one of things I always wonder I I d love you to talk about both of those issues You once said to me that Facebook might turn out to be the most transparent company in history which I I I don t know if you remember that but I was so excited 00 11 30 when you said it because I thought that was such a great idea and because I always believed that you company would have inordinate influence in the world partly because you are such a good leader and because it was such a good idea and obviously it s continued to be successful but what goes on behind under the covers is not very well understood right Could we have become to understand it better so that people would be not so suspicious about things like those things I mentioned    00 12 00 So when it comes to News Feed ranking I actually think we are very transparent Every time we add a new signal or make a change we publish that Right We explain why we are doing it and what signal we are adding and we bring people in to talk to them about it So you know that that stuff is out there and we will continue to do that I mean that s a that s a big um that s a big part of what we do and we and we take that seriously Um you know I ve seen some of stories you are talking about around this election  00 12 30 You know personally I think uh the the idea that fake news on Facebook of of which you know it s it s a very small of of of the content uh influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea right And it s um you know voters make decisions based on their lived experience right I mean they you kind of one part of this that I think is important is we 00 13 00 really believe in people right and and that they can you don t generally go wrong when you trust that people understand what they care about and what s important to them and you build systems that reflect that You know part of what I think is going on here is people are trying to understand the result of the election um but I do think that there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone 00 13 30 could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news Right I think if you believe that um then I don t think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in in this election and just to to  Speaker 1 Which which is what What would you say   Well well let me finish on this for for a second The you know and the quickest way to I think refute the fact that this surely had no impact is you know why would you think that there would be fake news on one side but not on the other We know we study this um we know that s it s a very small volume of anything You know hoaxes aren t new on Facebook right I 00 14 00 mean it s there have been hoaxes on the internet and there were hoaxes before and we do our best to make it so that people can can report that and um and and so that we can as I said before show people the most meaningful content that that we can You know I think the idea that um that that that had any impact on the election is is crosstalk 00 14 20  Speaker 1 Well I I don t disagree with you on that although it s interesting several of the tech journalists who happen to be here today specifically mentioned it as 00 14 30 something that is of concern for them right now so I think they will be glad you commented on it but what about the idea of the filter bubble Which is a bigger concept and I think here is one people talk about all the time I am something of a Facebook expert as you know and I m often talking to people about Facebook and I can t tell you how often they tell want to talk about this idea that they believe passionately that somehow it s distorting the way the world works   Well look I mean we ve studied this a lot because I mean you can imagine I really care about this  Speaker 1 I know you do    00 15 00 I want what we do to have a a good impact on the world Um I I want people to have a diversity of information so this is why we study this stuff to make sure we we are having that positive impact Um and for whatever reason so you know so all the research that we haves suggests that this isn t really a problem Um and I can go into that in a second but for whatever reason we ve had a really hard time getting that out but um but here here is the historical analogy that I think is is useful on this  00 15 30 If you go back you know 20 years and and look at the media landscape there were a few major TV networks right In in any given local area there were a few major newspapers that each had uh a an editorial opinion and those were were your opinions right that that you basically you you got all your news filtered through that Now  Speaker 1  inaudible 00 15 46 received from media through that   Through that now you know regardless of um what leaning you have on on Facebook politically or what your background is the you know all the research would show that you know almost everyone has some friends who 00 16 00 are on the other side Right So even if 90 of your friends even if you are a Democrat and 90 of your friends are Democrats probably 10 of your friends are Republicans  Speaker 1 That s what your your research has found   Yes absolutely  Speaker 1 Yeah   And even if you live in some state or some country you are going to know some people who live in another state or another city or another country um  Speaker 1 That s encouraging because a lot of people I know say I don t know anybody who supports the other person I happen to so it s nice but but I m glad you said that Keep going    00 16 30 I mean I think they probably do whether whether that person is talking about it is crosstalk 00 16 32 a different situation  Speaker 1 Well okay maybe okay there you go   Um so what we found and you can go through everything You can go through religion You can go through ethnic background just all of these different things and that kind of diversity is true I mean people tend to you know even if even if in in most cases or a lot of cases the majority of of someone s friend might fit their beliefs um there are always some who don t That means that the media diversity and diversity of information that you are getting through a social system like Facebook um is going to be inherently 00 17 00 more diverse than what you would have gotten from you know watching one of the three news stations and um and sticking with them and having that be your newspaper or your TV station um 20 years ago Now the research also shows something which is a little bit less uh inspiring which is that we we show we study not only um people s exposure in News Feed to content from different points of view but then what people click on 00 17 30 and engage with By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn t there that you don t have friend who support the other candidate or that or are of another religion but it s that you just don t click on it You actually tune it out when you see it Right So I mean people you know you you have your world view and you you go through and um you know I I think that we would all be surprised how many things that don t conform to our world view that we just tune it out  Speaker 1 They just float it down the feed    00 18 00 Yeah we just don t click on them and you know I don t know what to do I don t know what to do about that Right I mean I think we should work on that I think um we you know presenting people with a diversity of information I think do think is an important problem in the world and one that I hope we can make more progress on but right now the problem isn t that the diverse information isn t there um it is actually I think by any study it is is more there than in traditional media in the last generation but um but we haven t gotten people to engage within the higher proportions  Speaker 1 Well that s that s interesting that you know nonetheless you d still like to 00 18 30 find tools to address that so I guess that leads to the next question which was closely related you know since the News Feed is so important in democracy now I mean in almost every country in the country except North Korea and China and hardly any others right maybe Russia there are some other systems that are predominant but you are doing well even in Russia So uh what speci when you think about Face the role of the News Feed in 00 19 00 democracy what special responsibility do you feel you have because of its incredible importance   Well the number one thing we do is give people a voice right And that s that goes for every person and it goes for the candidates too right To be able to speak directly to the people that they that they are trying to lead and that is a profound thing In the US you know most of us have had the internet for a long time and we have other tools so you know having something like Facebook you know again most of the things we do in a day to day basis isn t to 00 19 30 engage in political debates right It s we we share photos of our children right And um we we hangout with our friends right and we get updates on on our friends lives and that s I think most of what around the world people would find the most meaningful on on Facebook In the US if you wanted to engage in that kind of debate if you wanted to get access to that kind of content you would have had venues to have done that before Facebook So Facebook might help right It might make it so now you have an additional venue and now you have new ways to get access to more 00 20 00 diverse news and follow more kinds of news but when you look at a country that is the majority of the people are just getting on the internet for the first time when they have no tool like this the data is way more profound People go from legitimately having very few tools to make their voice heard to now having uh some very powerful ones and that can have big effects on on civic discourse and make societies more open and and be very positive 00 20 30 And we we are very proud of that impact but you know I I again I mean I really believe in people Right I think it would be hard to do what what what we do if I didn t but I believe that people are smart and that people understand what is important to them and uh and and can tell you what their problems are and what they think are going to be the solutions to them and often don t need some else to come do that I believe that you know whether you are trying to build a company or run for office or whatever it is that you are trying to do it s generally a good idea to 00 21 00 bet on the intelligence of people and you know even if an election doesn t go the way you want I I still think that giving more people a voice over the long term is going to lead towards a more open and better society where where we are just more functional and and we we have the ability to make more progress  Speaker 1 Well I happen to personal completely buy that you feel that way and I I have admired that I think it is one of the key reasons why Facebook has grown so steadily for so long and will probably continue but you have to admit that 00 21 30 there are that you get into some weird situations like for example this issues of whether Trump was committing hate speech under the terms of Facebook service terms for service and You know according to the Wall Street Journal you personal had to intervene over your people who said This is a violation In order to say No the ter this is the democratic process at that level we can t interfere That s making an extremely important intervention in essentially social 00 22 00 discourse around I mean not that I think you were wrong by the way but it it is a extraordinarily huge responsibility to have to make that kind of decision I mean and that s happening in  s head Right   Yeah I mean there is a shift that is going on which is so I mean we ve spent a lot of time talking about News Feed and what News Feed shows and now what you are asking about is the community guidelines so what content is allowed on the service You know when we started the north start for us we are 00 22 30 building a safe community we are building a community where people feel comfortable being their real selves and and we were always going to be safe sharing those opinions and we are going really fight things like bullying um and hate speech One of the things that has shifted is that now uh news is a more important part of of what Facebook is When we got started 00 23 00 and there was no News Feed and there was no news on Facebook and now people do share more news and um we ve had to weight uh news worthiness and and um and as kind of higher part of the community guidelines We are still working through what that means right I think to to be honest uh but I think we are getting a lot of feedback and a lot of criticism I think a lot of it is fair um from a lot of folks arou around the world uh who are saying that you know more different things should be permitted and you know I mean you are talking to someone who s I mean it s like my 00 23 30 mission is to give more people a voice I mean that resonates with me when people say that and I think what we need to do is is figure out how to square these these two things um building a safe community which I still things is is the more important north star and what people need because again most of what happens on Facebook is not political discourse it s really people connecting with their friends and that is uh what is meaningful We do need to figure out how how to be this this place where people can uh get more of their content that s uh that s that s important news that s 00 24 00 going on and tha and again I believe that people will tell us what we need to do here Um our the goal that we have with the community guidelines isn t to have kind of our opinion be imposed it is really to reflect what people want  Speaker 1 So I mean in in to take what you are saying con concretely and literally even the decision that you reportedly made about Trump would ultimately be something that the software itself would be able to have instantiated within it It s just you haven t gotten there yet    00 24 30 Um a little bit but what I m more saying is that we setup these community guidelines and our real goal is to reflect what our community wants  Speaker 1 Okay so   Right so you know I mean that kind of content we would have thought that previously that would make a lot of people feel uncomfortable and um people wouldn t want that but at the point where the person who is elected president of the United States um is expressing that um opinion and has 60 million people who are who are followers then the question is okay that that is mainstream political discourse that I think we need to be pretty careful 00 25 00 about about saying that that s not that that s not a reason crosstalk 00 25 04  Speaker 1 I totally get that but but I guess just and I want to end this section of the interview but but I want to do it by asking this which is really the macro question of this whole ca category in my opinion which is that Facebook has acquired this extraordinary social cultural weight I mean beyond any commercial enterprise in human history in my opinion I m so happy that somebody as I don t know anybody in here disagree with that  Audience No  Speaker 1  00 25 30 I mean honestly I think that s pretty well accepted that   Uh all right well  Audience  inaudible 00 25 35  Speaker 1 What  Audience  inaudible 00 25 37   Yeah thank you thank you  Speaker 1 I ve talked uh no but I said commercial enterprise   All right  Speaker 1 I didn t hear some of that but I basically don t think that it s in any case it s extraordinarily influential right So the question is you know what are the 00 26 00 checks and balances that need to exist for co this new kind of entity You know and do you think about that Because at the moment it seems like you are the check and balance because you are a very socially conscious human being and I totally buy that I mean that s it s all over my book Anybody can read the book and know that but but it you know now that Facebook has two billion going to probably four billion users you know you have a sort of social responsibility that no company has ever had before I 00 26 30 guess I m just I just want to hear one last thought about how you are going to navigate that   Well again it s really listening to what people want Right It s I I I don t view my my goal and and and you know what I care about is giving people the power to share giving every person a voice so we can make the world more open and connected Right That s that s the mission Um you know that requires you know building a good version of News Feed that I think we are going to do the best work when we can incorporate how people 00 27 00 value each piece of content in and and we still have work to do on that I m learning how people feel about these different things and and what people find valuable and we are going to keep working on that and keep improving it and you will see more there Uh on the community guidelines I think as norms change and as people uh want to see more news I think 00 27 30 they ll we ll have to continue to evolve uh the guidelines to to reflect the values that the community holds This is a really challenging things because it s  Speaker 1 First of all when you are in 180 countries crosstalk 00 27 35    00 28 00 Yeah I was just going to say that right It s you know I mean because the norms are not the same in every country Um we don t have offices in every country so we we do this is an area that I think we we have evolved a lot over the last 10 years I think we will continue evolving and um and when we make changes it s not necessarily because um you know something was so broken before it s just because this is part of the natural evolution If you are building a system you improve over time that s what you do right That s that s our job is to make it as good as it possibly can be and you know this is a competitive space Right I mean there are there are certainly other companies that are trying to give people tools to share um you know some are growing well some aren t but you know I don t think that this is a granted that if we were if we fall off our game and don t serve people with 00 28 30 it it with what our community wants that you know we don t just continue growing right I mean you you look at how these different companies do or growing you know some are growing and some aren t and you know I think we need to keep doing a good job I think partially why we have had a lot of success is because we have been so attentive and listened to our community um which often includes feedback on both sides Right People telling us that you know we are not open enough in some place and then often these people say we are too open in that 00 29 00 place so we need to balance that and it s tough to make everyone happy but um but we care We care about learning quickly and making this better and better and better and I think that is we need to do that to succeed um as company We need to do that to succeed at the mission which is ultimately what I care about a lot more  Speaker 1 Well that s that s a good answer but are you confident that that process is systematized beyond simply depending on you and Sheryl and Chris Cox and a few others really enlightened leaders    00 29 30 I mean yeah we we are building the company every day and putting in new processes and new ways to research this and get different feedback and the world is pretty dynamic and things are changing pretty quickly  Speaker 1 I mean but this I don t want to beat a dead horse but the reason I wonder about that I mean if the three of you what if you were hit by a bus right I don t want that but you you know that s   The proverbial bus  Speaker 1 You know give given given the quantity of data about individuals that resides inside Facebook I mean look at the push back you are getting in Europe for example along with Google and other companies but you know 00 30 00 they certainly aren t entirely reassured in many countries about this My own opinion is you need to talk about these process and this the values more and I think you are doing a great job today but I I do wonder about the systematization of protections of a lot of factors that play into Facebook s social weight essentially I don t want I don t think you even have to answer that anymore but uh    00 30 30 I mean this is it s an evolving system I mean it s it uh you know it s not fully formed right and we will keep on improving it crosstalk 00 30 38 just like in your community you keep on you keep on trying to improve it  Speaker 1 But isn t it weird that it s not fully formed and it s huge   No no no no no no no I mean this is everything nothing nothing is not finished  Speaker 1 Okay okay good okay so let s go onto some other topics Um I just wanted to ask you you know what Techonomy is all about our little company which 00 31 00 we have our own face in um is about bringing together leaders of all types for collective conversation about technology transforming the world When you look at you know you spend time more time and probably have more access to more leaders of all types than probably many people that I can think of and when you do that what s the do you feel like that kind of dialogue is happening enough about how important technology is to global transformation and social transformation    00 31 30 You know when I go to different countries I like to the entrepreneurs and developers because I find that they are more often the ones who are focusing on that right So often times I ll I ll go listen meet with the leader but you know I I personally get more satisfaction from meeting with the entrepreneur on the ground um who are actually building the things and you know this I think is even going back to your question about everyone is trying to figure out what the election result means this week  00 32 00 I think it s easy to underestimate how much of the progress is made not by governments but by individuals and engineers and technologists and other folks who are private citizens and companies and NGOs who are building stuff and laying infrastructure and that infrastructure gets used by other companies to create exponentially accelerating progress That will all continue and you know one of the things that I think is really inspiring that I m lucky that I get to do is I get to travel around a lot  00 32 30 We focus on connecting people all over the world and I mean there is awesome stuff happening all over in in you know in every country Right I mean i just got from a trip to Nigeria Right And I mean it s super inspiring You get off the plane and you feel people s passion and you know you you it has this entrepreneurial attitude It s like we are going to get it done We are we are going to do this and um you know a country like Nigeria only about I think it s less than a quarter of the people are on the internet right 00 33 00 same in in a country like India less than a quarter of the people are on the internet You just think like all right how many brilliant people are out there who if we connected them it s not just that they would have more opportunity but that we would all be better off because the idea is in what in what they would produce right So that s that s something that really drives me right I think it s kind of crazy if you think about the world that you know we are here and less half of people in the world are on the internet I think if I mean that s not something that any one company can go sell by 00 33 30 ourselves but that s something that I feel uh you know responsibility to is is someone you know running a company whose mission is to connect everyone in the world and we we are making an impact You know internet org now has connected 40 million people to the internet who weren t on the internet before You know I I don t think that there s been a connectivity program in the world that is more successful than that right I think a lot of people think about is the initial free basics program that we rolled out but it s not just that at this point it s the solar empowered airplanes 00 34 00 laughs that we build in two years that you know now can fly around for months at a time and beam down connectivity It s it s express WIFI which is is rolled out in Nigeria and across India that we basically we ve build we we kind of call it an ISP in a box where we sell it to a local entrepreneur at cost to us because we are not trying to make money on this but then they can um sell connectivity and access to people in the in community  00 34 30 You know it s much better than us going in and putting a box there because we don t know where to put the box right But they do and it s their community You know if they are making money from it then you can bet that they have an incentive to make sure that that box keeps working and that people don t um don t break Right and you know that and all these different things I mean that is how you connect people overtime but that s that s what I care about when I go around the world You know that s that s I just think it s awfully inspiring right I mean to to meet all these folks and now it s changing crosstalk 00 34 55  Speaker 1 Well it has been amazing I I have spent time with you meeting with 00 35 00 entrepreneurs and engineers on occasion and it is your commitment to that is quite obvious and it s impressive Um let s shift to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative because that is something you haven t talked about too much in public and you are putting more and more energy into that You recently committed 3 billion to a project to cure all disease by 2100 is that   Yeah into the century I think it s possible  Speaker 1 Yeah yeah you do   Yeah  Speaker 1  00 35 30 Yeah no so that s great I mean it s hard to imagine what that would even mean but it s fantastic that you are willing to put that much energy into it Talk about the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative s basic goals and and approach We were talking about that a little bit before before we came out um what s the way you think about how that whole thing is going to work Because you ve said that part of that you are going to basically give away 99 of your wealth    00 36 00 Yeah so when when Priscilla and I were when Priscilla was pregnant with Max our our daughter uh we just had it was this great time to reflect on what kind of world we wanted her to grow in and you know we always thought that you know we were going to give away all of our money and we want to work on that but there is nothing like having a child to make you realize that the future is soon and that we want to do everything that we can to make sure that she can and everyone in her generation can have the best 00 36 30 lives that they can You know with the accelerating progress from technology and science there is no reason to believe that people in the next generation shouldn t be able to have much better lives than anything that we can have today but again these are long term investments It s not you know kind of a short term thing that uh that we talk about in in politics It s um you know or even quarterly earnings at a company I mean these are things that you know you build 00 37 00 infrastructure for five 10 20 years and you just make accelerating returns until it until it improves over time You know the the first areas that we are focusing on the first one has been education and personalized learning where I think that there s there s a big revolution that is happening that is giving teachers and students the tools to learn the the content that they care about the pace that fits them um learning in a way that fits them you know whether that s uh watching a video or playing a game or reading or working with other students or tutoring um giving people the tools that they need there  00 37 30 I actually think it would be cool to talk about that in a second because that s making incredible progress and uh I m just I mean I m really optimistic about that for the future I think most problems that society has I think you could you know if you fast forward a generation if you invest in education that s probably the best way to address them long term  Speaker 1 And that s one of your top priority   Yeah and that has been That that s been the first thing that we focused on and then you know we just announced this this early work in in in you know a handful of leaders in the science initiative with this goal to help cure 00 38 00 all diseases to help scientist cure all diseases by the end of the century and you know the reason why I think this is possible is if you look at the long arch of science for thousands of thousands of thousands of years humans made no progress right Or made very little progress If you measure it by life expectancy then in the last about 100 years really more like the last 70 years we ve been much more rigorous about we started 00 38 30 applying the scientific method to studying diseases and since then life expectancy has gone up by an average of a quarter of a year every year for the last 100 years Right so I mean life expectancy has gone up from about 50 to about 75 depending on where uh what country you are talking about It s been linear it s not like there some some jump uh and then it stopped or there was diminishing returns If we continue making progress there is I think there is a very good reason to 00 39 00 believe that that will continue for the next hundred years and that by the time we get to the end of this century um it will be pretty normal for people to live you know well past 100 right Which of course implies that we would have had to resolve most of the diseases that that people have today Now and then when you look into it further um it turns out that most people die from only like five category of things right And and then when you look into the history of science what I think becomes really clear is that most big scientific breakthroughs are driven by new tools right new ways of 00 39 30 seeing things right So the microscope allowed us to see you know uh bacterial and cells and study cell biology and make a lot of progress on that The telescope led us to the universe and um really unlocked a lot of astronomy DNA sequencing right thi this is all technology Right Technology gives people tools tools allow us to observe things and make these breakthroughs so that gets to okay so what can we do Right I mean yeah sure we can we can give money um in the grand scheme of things you 00 40 00 know government have way more money than we do to give so you know 3 billion is a lot of money and I think we can um we can make some progress there but I actually think the big impact that we are going to have is not just that it is building tools and doing engineering Right so in in a way the strategy for the Chan Zuckerberg initiative is really to bring engineering to social change right because what we found you know we we can big impact through Facebook um and then there are 00 40 30 things like internet org where know we are not just putting up WIFI hotspots we are we are building planes and building ISP in a box or with express WIFI and and building systems that integrate with inaudible 00 40 35 so so it s the the ability to do both philanthropy and build tools and do engineering um is is I think how you make the most progress We found that with education um and I think that that s going to be true with science too So the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is probably the only philanthropic organization in the world which is going to have a big world 00 41 00 class engineering team right That s a big that s a big part of of what we believe and I think we bring something kind of unique to that right having having built a good engineering team at Facebook  Speaker 1 You just hired a major person   Yeah we just hired a our CTO Brian Pinkerton He ran all of search and A9 at Amazon before uh long career there really impressive guy uh and you know a a handful of folks who I ve known and worked with for a while um have have come over We are building the engineering team at at CZI uh to do a lot of this work in education and and science I mean I can I I m and 00 41 30 this is something I m really passionate about and can talk about for a while but let me just tell one story on the on the education side that I think kind of captures this really clearly When Priscilla and I were first starting to think about personalized learning you know we look at okay which of the schools do this the best and one of the schools that has the best results is this network of chatter schools called 00 42 00 Summit Public Schools It s founded by this woman Diane Tavenner It s based out here and so we went to visit it one day One of the big things that they do is they you you walk in it it almost feels like a start up Right I mean the students are are at their desks right and it s not a lecture They they are working together in teams They have computers They they have their plans for what they are trying to do their personalized learning plans they kind of go in whatever order they 00 42 30 want The teachers are coming out and helping them The results are great One of the central parts of what is they have this personalized learning software So I go I asked Diane Well okay so you have great results and the software seems to be an important part of what you are doing Can I meet your engineering team So she says Yeah I will introduce you to him  Speaker 1  laughs   I m I m just are you kidding You have one dude building this And she is like Yeah look I m I m a teacher Right I m I m not an engineering 00 43 00 manager I don t know I mean that s not my thing I don t build an engineering team Um she is like If anything I m lucky that we have an engineer because there were all these other schools that could benefit from that but don t so we support them right through through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and we help them build more school but by far the most important thing that we ve done is we ve built an engineering team for her Right um you know the agreement that we had was look uh we ll do this 00 43 30 but you the only thing that we have to agree on is that we are not just going to use the software for Summit Schools We are going to make it to any school that wants can use this software She is like That s great You know as a matter of fact a lot of schools come through and they they want to use what we are using but again we just have one dude so um so it s barely enough to even fix the issues that we have um we can t we can t support anyone else yet So now we ve built a team at Facebook This is at this is at Facebook um that has more than 20 engineers working on this In the first year of working 00 44 00 on it we rolled it out beyond the Summit Schools to 20 more school across the country um public schools um districts schools chatter private In the last year the second year we rolled out to a hundred more school and this year coming we will roll out to hundreds and hundreds of more schools There are about 25 000 um middle and high schools in the country so it is not inconceivable that if you fast forward five years from now uh a very 00 44 30 meaningful percent of schools in the country will and and teachers will will have these tools to deliver a personalized education to students that again through all the standardized testing shows uh performs very well compared to a lot of traditional methods So that is bringing engineering to social change right giving money and doing and doing philanthropy to fund this and to train the teachers and to and to build the model and and doing engineering to build this You know on 00 45 00 the science side the opportunities are are are kind of endless well I mean we go around I probably talked to a hundred different scientist before we started the science initiative and hear similar stories right I mean it s um you ask I remember I was talking to someone who is doing brain mapping right I mean understanding the brain is going to be one the next huge frontiers for science In the last 15 to 20 years we started getting more of an understanding of our genomes but we don t really have much of an understanding of how the brain works not not just the diseases 00 45 30 neurological and neo degenerative diseases but we don t really understand how it works when it s working correctly so it s going to be an important thing One of the first things that we need to do is we need to map it out So there there a lot of scientists who are working on this and when explain their work a lot of the a lot of it comes down to some manual things that are expensive for people to do or taking you know uh a brain and of a mouse or a fly and slicing it up to you can trace how the neurons go through it so you can just perform a map of what the brain is and you know to somebody who is a 00 46 00 trained computer scientist like like me you listen to that and your reaction is that is an engineering problem um or at least that part of it so instead of taking five to 10 years and doing this manually and having it cost hundreds of millions of dollars let s build a team of 20 engineers to do that in two years um so that we can accelerate the whole field You ask these folks well why why hasn t that happened And it s kind of the same thing It s the NIH grants don t support building a big engineering 00 46 30 team right So and every once in a while maybe I will get a computer science post doc who will come by my lab and he will work for us or she will work for us and then you ll hire them at Facebook laughs  Speaker 1 Right and I m sure you hire them   They work on they work on ads targeting or search or something like that and um and you know so I think that this is a big area where we can make a big difference in the world right And that s what we are going to do at at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is build up a a big world class engineering team that can work with scientist around the world teachers around the 00 47 00 world um to solve these problems and make progress It s not just uh donating money to build a school or um although that s really important too This is infrastructure that people will build on that will accrue that will accelerate over time and this is why I m so optimistic that that we are going to continue to making progress um and I mean this is what I think we need to do  Speaker 1  00 47 30 The optimism is quite palpable but that s is what we call very techonomic by the way Um now we didn t get into the future as Facebook as much as I would like and we are pretty much out of time but I really would like to take a few questions from the audience if is that all right with you   Yeah go for it it s all right  Speaker 1 Okay now uh okay all right let s take this right here Identify yourself please  Cameron Hey Mark I m Cameron inaudible 00 47 55 and I m very inspired by your talk   Thank you  Cameron  00 48 00 And highly appreciate what you talked about your education effort and which you visited in Nigeria particularly because uh all the countries across Africa Middle East and Central Asia have been adversely affected their economy by drop of price of oil and when you go to Nigeria or you go to any of the Middle Eastern countries you will see the hunger that the youth have and 00 48 30 entrepreneurship and high tech is the answer that brings them hope I was there a few months years ago 10 000 entrepreneurs and entrepreneur wannabes came to uh you know see me and get advice about how to create jobs because lack of jobs is a cancer in for any society so I just wanted to thank you for the great work that you are doing plus the internet work that you do    00 49 00 Yeah I mean I I completely agree with what you are saying and I appreciate that I mean building knowledge economies around the world and modernizing these economies I think is one of the most important things that we can do There s there s a a big trend where you know I don t know how how many of you have heard this this term the resource curse right and there are a lot of countries that you know if you have oil right or you have some natural resource it prevents you know a country from it creates the 00 49 30 wrong incentives right because having a resource is inaudible 00 49 33 right and it makes it so that the the game in that country becomes how do you control that resource The thing about knowledge economies and connecting people and giving people the tools to do entrepreneurial endeavors themselves and having an education system that doesn t just promote learning but also um you know self direction right and being able to explore the things they want and be 00 50 00 more entrepreneurial you know that just builds on itself Right And and that I think that is one of the most important things that we need to do in next generation is enabling that to get built Um you know connectivity I think is one of the big things around that You know when you look at the stats around it there is a lot of research that shows that for every 10 people who get connected to the internet about one person gets lifted out of poverty and about one job gets created You know it may seem not obvious right It may seem if you are if you are in a place 00 50 30 where people um lack jobs or um you know there isn t a good education system or good health system that you d want to do that stuff first but the reason why connectivity is so important is that if you live in a place where there isn t a good school the internet is probably your best bet to get access to good information right And learn about what s going on around the world Um if you live in a place where there isn t a good doctor nearby uh having 00 51 00 access to the internet might be your best bet at um at getting access to the health information you need to help raise your family safely and I think as AI continues progressing that will certainly continue to be true Um as an aside I heard this pretty inspiring story recently where at an AI conference someone showed a tool that they had built where you can just take a picture on a cell phone of a lesion on your skin and instantly the system could detect 00 51 30 whether it was skin cancer with the accuracy of the best doctors in the world Right so that s AI Right I mean that s why I m so confident it s going to save people s lives but again you know the future you get people connectivity they are going to get access to tools like that and you know that s the next best thing to having a good doctor Right In in some places it might be better uh you know so I mean this is this is uh I think could be very important for building up the the knowledge economy around the world It s one of the reasons why I care so much about about about connecting 00 52 00 people even though I think a lot of folks um you know we have to do other things to It s not the only thing but I think this is a part critical enabling infrastructure for for the world  Speaker 1 I will just say Cameron is going the be on stage tomorrow morning talking about an amazing set of projects that he has that are totally relate to this issue and it s quite impressive Um I just want to know if I can take wh who I don t want to get in up here but   You are going to  Speaker 1 Am I So can I take one more   Yeah take a couple more  Speaker 1  00 52 30 Well well if I don t get in trouble with you that s good but I don t want to get in trouble with your people   I don t think we can take all of these but but but  Speaker 1 No we cannot take all of these   Take two Take two You choose not me  Speaker 1 Okay okay uh let s take this guy here who I don t know so I can t even guess what he would say I can t tell who that is Yeah  Mark Webster Mark Webster I d just love to hear more about your personal smart home and the lesson you sort of learned in that project   Yeah so you know every year I have a personal challenge This year I decided to have two I decided to to build an AI to help control the home and 00 53 00 because I assumed that that would lead to me sitting around a lot more I also have a challenge to run on average one mile a day for the year so that one is actually done That turned to be easier and unto unto bigger things there but in terms of the AI um it s going well Uh the biggest thing that I have kind of taken away from it is that most of my work has actually gone into um into 00 53 30 integrating with the different systems in the home because that stuff is all really fragmented We talk about the smart home and and that being a big trend but I think a lot of these things just need to get standardized right the music system the um like the lights and the temperature and like just all these different parts of of um things that go into your home There is not a like a great API to do all 00 54 00 that today so it s taken I don t know maybe 15 20 hours um just to do all of that integration before you even get into doing anything interesting Um and then on top of that one of the things that s been pretty fun about this project is you know I don t get to write a lot of code and Facebook isn t code based anymore We we have a rule that if you make a change you have to support your change right So if it breaks you have to drop whatever you doing to fix it I feel like I d be kind of a jerk if I made some other engineer 00 54 30 go fix my change at Facebook So so I kind of gave up on on coding within the Facebook system but this has given me a reason to play around with a lot of the different AI tools that we ve built internally Right so things like face recognition and image recognition and speech recognition and it I just think it s so impressive how how much progress we ve made um on some of things I mean it s not that they don t need to to improve or that I haven t need to do work to integrate that for example but 00 55 00 understanding kind of state of the art how far how much these systems have made progresses is really inspiring I I believe that by within five or 10 years we are going to have AI systems that are better than people at all of our main senses Right that that doesn t mean that they are going to intelligent right They are not going to have common sense They will be able to go from one domain to understand another that that is a uh a big leap that we have to make that we haven t yet but in terms of being able to see and and kind of 00 55 30 understand what we are seeing better I think um computers will be better that AI will be better at that In terms of hearing um and understanding language and understanding the the concepts and things I think we are going to get to world pretty soon where computers will be uh better at all of that and that is going to be really powerful in a lot of ways You know one of my one of my favorite examples recently is we built this AI is part of Facebook that we we wanted to be able to look at an image and understand what s in it and one of one of effects of that is now for visually 00 56 00 impaired people in our community we can now speak to them what is in an image or a video right and that s really powerful There are hundreds of millions of people around the world who are visually impaired It s hard to use Facebook if you don t have something like that So AI I think is going to be really powerful for all those things and this experience this year of building this has only I I think strengthened my belief about how good that is going to be but in terms of home automation stuff I think there is a bunch of work to do just basic home automation and infrastructure  Speaker 1  00 56 30 Well I don t think we should take any more questions but I just got to say the the world is lucky that someone with your optimism has your ability to execute so thank you for that   Thank you  Speaker 1 I also think you do a really good job talking about what you are doing and I hope you do it more because it s really good Thank you so much for being here   Thank you guys Thank you  Speaker 1 Really good thanks Mark I will be right back there Okay Okay well that 00 57 00 concludes the plenary for today but '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2016-063', 'content': '  My personal challenge for 2016 was to build a simple AI to run my home like Jarvis in Iron Man My goal was to learn about the state of artificial intelligence where we re further along than people realize and where we re still a long ways off These challenges always lead me to learn more than I expected and this one also gave me a better sense of all the internal technology Facebook engineers get to use as well as a thorough overview of home automation So far this year I ve built a simple AI that I can talk to on my phone and computer that can control my home including lights temperature appliances music and security that learns my tastes and patterns that can learn new words and concepts and that can even entertain Max It uses several artificial intelligence techniques including natural language processing speech recognition face recognition and reinforcement learning written in Python PHP and Objective C In this note I ll explain what I built and what I learned along the way Diagram of the systems connected to build Jarvis Getting Started Connecting the HomeIn some ways this challenge was easier than I expected In fact my running challenge I also set out to run 365 miles in 2016 took more total time But one aspect that was much more complicated than I expected was simply connecting and communicating with all of the different systems in my home Before I could build any AI I first needed to write code to connect these systems which all speak different languages and protocols We use a Crestron system with our lights thermostat and doors a Sonos system with Spotify for music a Samsung TV a Nest cam for Max and of course my work is connected to Facebook s systems I had to reverse engineer APIs for some of these to even get to the point where I could issue a command from my computer to turn the lights on or get a song to play Further most appliances aren t even connected to the internet yet It s possible to control some of these using internet connected power switches that let you turn the power on and off remotely But often that isn t enough For example one thing I learned is it s hard to find a toaster that will let you push the bread down while it s powered off so you can automatically start toasting when the power goes on I ended up finding an old toaster from the 1950s and rigging it up with a connected switch Similarly I found that connecting a food dispenser for Beast or a grey t shirt cannon would require hardware modifications to work For assistants like Jarvis to be able to control everything in homes for more people we need more devices to be connected and the industry needs to develop common APIs and standards for the devices to talk to each other An example natural language request from command line Natural LanguageOnce I wrote the code so my computer could control my home the next step was making it so I could talk to my computer and home the way I d talk to anyone else This was a two step process first I made it so I could communicate using text messages and later I added the ability to speak and have it translate my speech into text for it to read It started simple by looking for keywords like bedroom lights and on to determine I was telling it to turn the lights on in the bedroom It quickly became clear that it needed to learn synonyms like that family room and living room mean the same thing in our home This meant building a way to teach it new words and concepts Understanding context is important for any AI For example when I tell it to turn the AC up in my office that means something completely different from when Priscilla tells it the exact same thing That one caused some issues Or for example when you ask it to make the lights dimmer or to play a song without specifying a room it needs to know where you are or it might end up blasting music in Max s room when we really need her to take a nap Whoops Music is a more interesting and complex domain for natural language because there are too many artists songs and albums for a keyword system to handle The range of things you can ask it is also much greater Lights can only be turned up or down but when you say play X even subtle variations can mean many different things Consider these requests related to Adele play someone like you play someone like adele and play some adele Those sound similar but each is a completely different category of request The first plays a specific song the second recommends an artist and the third creates a playlist of Adele s best songs Through a system of positive and negative feedback an AI can learn these differences The more context an AI has the better it can handle open ended requests At this point I mostly just ask Jarvis to play me some music and by looking at my past listening patterns it mostly nails something I d want to hear If it gets the mood wrong I can just tell it for example that s not light play something light and it can both learn the classification for that song and adjust immediately It also knows whether I m talking to it or Priscilla is so it can make recommendations based on what we each listen to In general I ve found we use these more open ended requests more frequently than more specific asks No commercial products I know of do this today and this seems like a big opportunity Jarvis uses face recognition to let my friends in automatically and let me know Vision and Face RecognitionAbout one third of the human brain is dedicated to vision and there are many important AI problems related to understanding what is happening in images and videos These problems include tracking eg is Max awake and moving around in her crib object recognition eg is that Beast or a rug in that room and face recognition eg who is at the door Face recognition is a particularly difficult version of object recognition because most people look relatively similar compared to telling apart two random objects for example a sandwich and a house But Facebook has gotten very good at face recognition for identifying when your friends are in your photos That expertise is also useful when your friends are at your door and your AI needs to determine whether to let them in To do this I installed a few cameras at my door that can capture images from all angles AI systems today cannot identify people from the back of their heads so having a few angles ensures we see the person s face I built a simple server that continuously watches the cameras and runs a two step process first it runs face detection to see if any person has come into view and second if it finds a face then it runs face recognition to identify who the person is Once it identifies the person it checks a list to confirm I m expecting that person and if I am then it will let them in and tell me they re here This type of visual AI system is useful for a number of things including knowing when Max is awake so it can start playing music or a Mandarin lesson or solving the context problem of knowing which room in the house we re in so the AI can correctly respond to context free requests like turn the lights on without providing a location Like most aspects of this AI vision is most useful when it informs a broader model of the world connected with other abilities like knowing who your friends are and how to open the door when they re here The more context the system has the smarter is gets overall I can text Jarvis from anywhere using a Messenger bot Messenger BotI programmed Jarvis on my computer but in order to be useful I wanted to be able to communicate with it from anywhere I happened to be That meant the communication had to happen through my phone not a device placed in my home I started off building a Messenger bot to communicate with Jarvis because it was so much easier than building a separate app Messenger has a simple framework for building bots and it automatically handles many things for you working across both iOS and Android supporting text image and audio content reliably delivering push notifications managing identity and permissions for different people and more You can learn about the bot framework at messenger com platform I can text anything to my Jarvis bot and it will instantly be relayed to my Jarvis server and processed I can also send audio clips and the server can translate them into text and then execute those commands In the middle of the day if someone arrives at my home Jarvis can text me an image and tell me who s there or it can text me when I need to go do something One thing that surprised me about my communication with Jarvis is that when I have the choice of either speaking or texting I text much more than I would have expected This is for a number of reasons but mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me If I m doing something that relates to them like playing music for all of us then speaking feels fine but most of the time text feels more appropriate Similarly when Jarvis communicates with me I d much rather receive that over text message than voice That s because voice can be disruptive and text gives you more control of when you want to look at it Even when I speak to Jarvis if I m using my phone I often prefer it to text or display its response This preference for text communication over voice communication fits a pattern we re seeing with Messenger and WhatsApp overall where the volume of text messaging around the world is growing much faster than the volume of voice communication This suggests that future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice and will need a private messaging interface as well Once you re enabling private messaging it s much better to use a platform like Messenger than to build a new app from scratch I have always been optimistic about AI bots but my experience with Jarvis has made me even more optimistic that we ll all communicate with bots like Jarvis in the future Jarvis uses speech recognition in my iOS app to listen to my request for a fresh t shirt Voice and Speech RecognitionEven though I think text will be more important for communicating with AIs than people realize I still think voice will play a very important role too The most useful aspect of voice is that it s very fast You don t need to take out your phone open an app and start typing you just speak To enable voice for Jarvis I needed to build a dedicated Jarvis app that could listen continuously to what I say The Messenger bot is great for many things but the friction for using speech is way too much My dedicated Jarvis app lets me put my phone on a desk and just have it listen I could also put a number of phones with the Jarvis app around my home so I could talk to Jarvis in any room That seems similar to Amazon s vision with Echo but in my experience it s surprising how frequently I want to communicate with Jarvis when I m not home so having the phone be the primary interface rather than a home device seems critical I built the first version of the Jarvis app for iOS and I plan to build an Android version soon too I hadn t built an iOS app since 2012 and one of my main observations is that the toolchain we ve built at Facebook since then for developing these apps and for doing speech recognition is very impressive Speech recognition systems have improved recently but no AI system is good enough to understand conversational speech just yet Speech recognition relies on both listening to what you say and predicting what you will say next so structured speech is still much easier to understand than unstructured conversation Another interesting limitation of speech recognition systems and machine learning systems more generally is that they are more optimized for specific problems than most people realize For example understanding a person talking to a computer is subtly different problem from understanding a person talking to another person If you train a machine learning system on data from Google of people speaking to a search engine it will perform relatively worse on Facebook at understanding people talking to real people In the case of Jarvis training an AI that you ll talk to at close range is also different from training a system you ll talk to from all the way across the room like Echo These systems are more specialized than it appears and that implies we are further off from having general systems than it might seem On a psychologic level once you can speak to a system you attribute more emotional depth to it than a computer you might interact with using text or a graphic interface One interesting observation is that ever since I built voice into Jarvis I ve also wanted to build in more humor Part of this is that now it can interact with Max and I want those interactions to be entertaining for her but part of it is that it now feels like it s present with us I ve taught it fun little games like Priscilla or I can ask it who we should tickle and it will randomly tell our family to all go tickle one of us Max or Beast I ve also had fun adding classic lines like I m sorry Priscilla I m afraid I can t do that There s a lot more to explore with voice The AI technology is just getting good enough for this to be the basis of a great product and it will get much better in the next few years At the same time I think the best products like this will be ones you can bring with you anywhere and communicate with privately as well Facebook Engineering EnvironmentAs the CEO of Facebook I don t get much time to write code in our internal environment I ve never stopped coding but these days I mostly build personal projects like Jarvis I expected I d learn a lot about the state of AI this year but I didn t realize I would also learn so much about what it s like to be an engineer at Facebook And it s impressive My experience of ramping up in the Facebook codebase is probably pretty similar to what most new engineers here go through I was consistently impressed by how well organized our code is and how easy it was to find what you re looking for whether it s related to face recognition speech recognition the Messenger Bot Framework messenger com platform or iOS development The open source Nuclide github com facebook nuclide packages we ve built to work with GitHub s Atom make development much easier The Buck buckbuild com build system we ve developed to build large projects quickly also saved me a lot of time Our open source FastText github com facebookresearch fastText AI text classification tool is also a good one to check out and if you re interested in AI development the whole Facebook Research github com facebookresearch GitHub repo is worth taking a look at One of our values is move fast That means you should be able to come here and build an app faster than you can anywhere else including on your own You should be able to come here and use our infra and AI tools to build things it would take you a long time to build on your own Building internal tools that make engineering more efficient is important to any technology company but this is something we take especially seriously So I want to give a shout out to everyone on our infra and tools teams that make this so good Next StepsAlthough this challenge is ending I m sure I ll continue improving Jarvis since I use it every day and I m always finding new things I want to add In the near term the clearest next steps are building an Android app setting up Jarvis voice terminals in more rooms around my home and connecting more appliances I d love to have Jarvis control my Big Green Egg and help me cook but that will take even more serious hacking than rigging up the t shirt cannon In the longer term I d like to explore teaching Jarvis how to learn new skills itself rather than me having to teach it how to perform specific tasks If I spent another year on this challenge I d focus more on learning how learning works Finally over time it would be interesting to find ways to make this available to the world I considered open sourcing my code but it s currently too tightly tied to my own home appliances and network configuration If I ever build a layer that abstracts more home automation functionality I may release that Or of course that could be a great foundation to build a new product ConclusionsBuilding Jarvis was an interesting intellectual challenge and it gave me direct experience building AI tools in areas that are important for our future I ve previously predicted that within 5 10 years we ll have AI systems that are more accurate than people for each of our senses vision hearing touch etc as well as things like language It s impressive how powerful the state of the art for these tools is becoming and this year makes me more confident in my prediction At the same time we are still far off from understanding how learning works Everything I did this year natural language face recognition speech recognition and so on are all variants of the same fundamental pattern recognition techniques We know how to show a computer many examples of something so it can recognize it accurately but we still do not know how to take an idea from one domain and apply it to something completely different To put that in perspective I spent about 100 hours building Jarvis this year and now I have a pretty good system that understands me and can do lots of things But even if I spent 1 000 more hours I probably wouldn t be able to build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own unless I made some fundamental breakthrough in the state of AI along the way In a way AI is both closer and farther off than we imagine AI is closer to being able to do more powerful things than most people expect driving cars curing diseases discovering planets understanding media Those will each have a great impact on the world but we re still figuring out what real intelligence is Overall this was a great challenge These challenges have a way of teaching me more than I expected at the beginning This year I thought I d learn about AI and I also learned about home automation and Facebook s internal technology too That s what s so interesting about these challenges Thanks for following along with this challenge and I m looking forward to sharing next year s challenge in a few weeks '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2016-085', 'content': '  My personal challenge for 2016 is to build a simple AI like Jarvis from Iron Man to help run my home and help me with work I m planning on writing up some thoughts every month on what I ve built and what I m learning I m still early in coding so I ll start this month with a summary of the state of the AI field Artificial intelligence may seem like something out of science fiction but most of us already use tools and services every day that rely on AI When you do a voice search on your phone put a check into an ATM or use a fitness tracker to count your steps you re using basic forms of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence More sophisticated AI systems can already diagnose diseases drive cars and search the skies for planets better than people This is why AI is such an exciting field it opens up so many new possibilities for enhancing humanity s capabilities So what can AI do and what are its limits What things is AI good at and what is AI bad at Simply put today s AI is good at recognizing patterns and bad at what we would call common sense The primary method used to train AI systems is called supervised learning This is like when you show a picture book to a child and tell them the names of everything they see If you show an AI thousands of pictures of dogs you can train it to start recognizing dogs You can teach AIs to do a lot of things this way For example we can teach an AI to recognize all of your friends faces by showing it thousands of photos and then it can suggest tags for the photos you upload on Facebook You can teach an AI to recognize speech by having it listen to thousands of hours of speeches throughout history while also showing it transcriptions of what was said You can teach an AI to diagnose melanoma by showing it thousands of photos of tumors You can even teach an AI how to drive a car and automatically brake by showing it thousands of examples of people and obstacles it might encounter on the road Diagnosing cancer driving cars transcribing speech playing games and tagging photos may sound like very different tasks but they re all examples of teaching an AI to recognize patterns by showing them many examples Many different problems can be reduced to pattern recognition tasks that sophisticated AIs can then solve This year I ll teach my simple AI to recognize patterns I ll train it to recognize my voice so I can control my home through speaking I ll train it to recognize my face so it can open the door when I m approaching and so on But there are lots of limitations of this approach For one to teach a person something new you typically don t need to tell them about it thousands of times So the state of the art in AI is still much slower than how we learn But more importantly pattern recognition is very different from common sense and nobody knows how to teach an AI that yet Without common sense AI systems can t use knowledge they ve learned in one area and easily apply it to another situation This means they can t effectively react to new problems or situations they haven t seen before which is so much of we all do everyday and what we call intelligence Our best guess at how to teach an AI common sense is through a method called unsupervised learning My example of supervised learning above was showing a picture book to a child and telling them the names of everything they see Unsupervised learning would be giving them a book and letting them figure out what to do with it They could pick it up and by touching it learn to turn the pages Or they could let go of it and realize it falls to the ground Unsupervised learning is learning how the world works by observing and trying things out rather than being told what to do This is how most animals learn It s key to building systems with human like common sense because it doesn t require a person to teach it everything they know It gives the machine the ability to anticipate what may happen in the future and predict the effect of an action It could help us build machines that can hold conversations or plan complex sequences of actions necessary components for any authentic Jarvis Unsupervised learning is a long term focus of our AI research team at Facebook and it remains an important challenge for the whole AI research community Since no one understands how general unsupervised learning actually works we re quite a ways off from building the general AIs you see in movies Some people claim this is just a matter of getting more computing power and that as Moore s law continues and computing becomes cheaper we ll naturally have AIs that surpass human intelligence This is incorrect We fundamentally do not understand how general learning works This is an unsolved problem maybe the most important problem of this century or even millennium Until we solve this problem throwing all the machine power in the world at it cannot create an AI that can do everything a person can We should not be afraid of AI Instead we should hope for the amazing amount of good it will do in the world It will saves lives by diagnosing diseases and driving us around more safely It will enable breakthroughs by helping us find new planets and understand Earth s climate It will help in areas we haven t even thought of today Jarvis is still a long way off and we re not going to solve most of these engineering challenges in the next year But I m glad to be joining the effort and doing what I can to push the field of AI forward '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2016-188', 'content': '  The technology behind AquilaTHURSDAY JULY 21 2016On June 28th we completed the first successful flight of Aquila our solar powered plane that will beam internet to remote parts of the world and eventually break the record for longest unmanned aircraft flight The flight took place before dawn in Yuma Arizona Our original mission was to fly Aquila for 30 minutes but things went so well that we decided to keep the plane up for 96 minutes We gathered lots of data about our models and the aircraft structure and after two years of development it was emotional to see Aquila actually get off the ground But as big as this milestone is we still have a lot of work to do Eventually our goal is to have a fleet of Aquilas flying together at 60 000 feet communicating with each other with lasers and staying aloft for months at a time something that s never been done before To get there we need to solve some difficult engineering challenges Here are a few that we re working on Weight Aquila has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 737 but has to weigh as little as possible to stay up for as long as possible That s why the body of the plane is made of a carbon fiber composite so the whole thing weighs less than 1 000 pounds or about the same as a grand piano We need to continue to make it lighter Power The amount of energy Aquila collects from the sun during the day has to be enough to keep its propellers communications payload avionics heaters and light systems running when it s dark That means using about 5 000W of power at cruising altitude or about as much as three hairdryers We re always looking for ways to trim this down and make our systems more efficient Control Aquila is mostly self sufficient but it still relies on a ground crew of about a dozen engineers pilots and technicians who direct maintain and monitor the aircraft They control the aircraft through software which allows them to determine heading altitude and airspeed or send Aquila on a GPS based route Takeoff and landing are automatic since no human pilot can land in a precise location as well as software can Speed When you see Aquila fly one of the most surprising things is how slow it goes That s on purpose In order to use the least amount of energy Aquila needs to go as slow as possible At higher altitudes where the air is thinner we ll be able to go a bit faster about 80 mph Altitude In order to take off fly and land Aquila s wings and propellers have to be able to operate both in high cold altitudes and lower warmer altitudes where the air can be 10 times denser We re working to figure out how much power that takes and what impact it will have on solar panel performance battery size latitude range and seasonal performance Load Almost half the mass of Aquila will come from high energy batteries That s a lot of weight to put on large flexible wings which is why we have computer models to predict how Aquila s shape deforms under load A few more flights will help us better understand the actual in flight dynamics Communications Aquila will carry a communications payload that will use lasers to transfer data more than 10 times faster than existing systems It will be able to aim its beams precisely enough to hit a dime more than 11 miles away while in motion Over the next year we re going to keep testing Aquila flying higher and longer and adding more planes and payloads It s all part of our mission to connect the world and help more of the 4 billion people who are not online access all the opportunities of the internet As we make progress we ll continue sharing what we learn To learn more check out this note from our engineers https code facebook com posts 268598690180189 Thanks for coming along for the ride '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-008', 'content': '  Harvard Commencement 2017President Faust Board of Overseers faculty alumni friends proud parents members of the ad board and graduates of the greatest university in the world I m honored to be with you today because let s face it you accomplished something I never could If I get through this speech it ll be the first time I actually finish something at Harvard Class of 2017 congratulations I m an unlikely speaker not just because I dropped out but because we re technically in the same generation We walked this yard less than a decade apart studied the same ideas and slept through the same Ec10 lectures We may have taken different paths to get here especially if you came all the way from the Quad but today I want to share what I ve learned about our generation and the world we re building together But first the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling you that you got into Harvard I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs got my dad and for some reason his reaction was to video me opening the email That could have been a really sad video I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for What about your first lecture at Harvard Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis I was late so I threw on a t shirt and didn t realize until afterwards it was inside out and backwards with my tag sticking out the front I couldn t figure out why no one would talk to me except one guy KX Jin he just went with it We ended up doing our problem sets together and now he runs a big part of Facebook And that Class of 2017 is why you should be nice to people But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla I had just launched this prank website Facemash and the ad board wanted to see me Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out My parents came to help me pack My friends threw me a going away party As luck would have it Priscilla was at that party with her friend We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower and in what must be one of the all time romantic lines I said I m going to get kicked out in three days so we need to go on a date quickly Actually any of you graduating can use that line I didn t end up getting kicked out I did that to myself Priscilla and I started dating And you know that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook It wasn t But without Facemash I wouldn t have met Priscilla and she s the most important person in my life so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here We ve all started lifelong friendships here and some of us even families That s why I m so grateful to this place Thanks Harvard Today I want to talk about purpose But I m not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose We re millennials We ll try to do that instinctively Instead I m here to tell you finding your purpose isn t enough The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center he saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing The janitor responded Mr President I m helping put a man on the moon Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves that we are needed that we have something better ahead to work for Purpose is what creates true happiness You re graduating at a time when this is especially important When our parents graduated purpose reliably came from your job your church your community But today technology and automation are eliminating many jobs Membership in communities is declining Many people feel disconnected and depressed and are trying to fill a void As I ve traveled around I ve sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do an after school program or somewhere to go I ve met factory workers who know their old jobs aren t coming back and are trying to find their place To keep our society moving forward we have a generational challenge to not only create new jobs but create a renewed sense of purpose I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House I went to Noch s with my friend KX I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community but one day someone would connect the whole world The thing is it never even occurred to me that someone might be us We were just college kids We didn t know anything about that There were all these big technology companies with resources I just assumed one of them would do it But this idea was so clear to us that all people want to connect So we just kept moving forward day by day I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this A change in the world that seems so clear you re sure someone else will do it But they won t You will But it s not enough to have purpose yourself You have to create a sense of purpose for others I found that out the hard way You see my hope was never to build a company but to make an impact And as all these people started joining us I just assumed that s what they cared about too so I never explained what I hoped we d build A couple years in some big companies wanted to buy us I didn t want to sell I wanted to see if we could connect more people We were building the first News Feed and I thought if we could just launch this it could change how we learn about the world Nearly everyone else wanted to sell Without a sense of higher purpose this was the startup dream come true It tore our company apart After one tense argument an advisor told me if I didn t agree to sell I would regret the decision for the rest of my life Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management team was gone That was my hardest time leading Facebook I believed in what we were doing but I felt alone And worse it was my fault I wondered if I was just wrong an imposter a 22 year old kid who had no idea how the world worked Now years later I understand that is how things work with no sense of higher purpose It s up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose by taking on big meaningful projects together by redefining equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue purpose and by building community across the world First let s take on big meaningful projects Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self driving cars and trucks But we have the potential to do so much more together Every generation has its defining works More than 300 000 people worked to put a man on the moon including that janitor Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects These projects didn t just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things Now it s our turn to do great things I know you re probably thinking I don t know how to build a dam or get a million people involved in anything But let me tell you a secret no one does when they begin Ideas don t come out fully formed They only become clear as you work on them You just have to get started If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began I never would have started Facebook Movies and pop culture get this all wrong The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie It makes us feel inadequate since we haven t had ours It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started Oh you know what else movies get wrong about innovation No one writes math formulas on glass That s not a thing It s good to be idealistic But be prepared to be misunderstood Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy even if you end up right Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge even though it s impossible to know everything upfront Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast because there s always someone who wants to slow you down In our society we often don t do big things because we re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing The reality is anything we do will have issues in the future But that can t keep us from starting So what are we waiting for It s time for our generation defining public works How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their genomes Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people don t get sick in the first place That makes no sense We can fix this How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online and personalizing education so everyone can learn These achievements are within our reach Let s do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role Let s do big things not only to create progress but to create purpose So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers Now we re all entrepreneurial whether we re starting projects or finding or role And that s great Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress An entrepreneurial culture thrives when it s easy to try lots of new ideas Facebook wasn t the first thing I built I also built games chat systems study tools and music players I m not alone JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail But today we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone When you don t have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise we all lose Right now our society is way over indexed on rewarding success and we don t do nearly enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots Let s face it There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can t afford to pay off their loans let alone start a business Look I know a lot of entrepreneurs and I don t know a single person who gave up on starting a business because they might not make enough money But I know lots of people who haven t pursued dreams because they didn t have a cushion to fall back on if they failed We all know we don t succeed just by having a good idea or working hard We succeed by being lucky too If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code if I didn t know I d be fine if Facebook didn t work out I wouldn t be standing here today If we re honest we all know how much luck we ve had Every generation expands its definition of equality Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights They had the New Deal and Great Society Now it s our time to define a new social contract for our generation We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things We re going to change jobs many times so we need affordable childcare to get to work and healthcare that isn t tied to one company We re all going to make mistakes so we need a society that focuses less on locking us up or stigmatizing us And as technology keeps changing we need a society that focuses more on continuous education throughout our lives And yes giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose isn t free People like me should pay for it Many of you will do well and you should too That s why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth to promoting equal opportunity These are the values of our generation It was never a question of if we were going to do this The only question was when Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history In one year three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised money for charity But it s not just about money You can also give time I promise you if you take an hour or two a week that s all it takes to give someone a hand to help them reach their potential Maybe you think that s too much time I used to When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher and before she d do education work with me she told me I needed to teach a class I complained Well I m kind of busy I m running this company But she insisted so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys and Girls Club I taught them lessons on product development and marketing and they taught me what it s like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison I shared stories from my time in school and they shared their hope of one day going to college too For five years now I ve been having dinner with those kids every month One of them even threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower And next year they re going to college Every one of them First in their families We can all make time to give someone a hand Let s give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose not only because it s the right thing to do but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great we re all better for it Purpose doesn t only come from work The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community And when our generation says everyone we mean everyone in the world Quick show of hands how many of you are from another country Now how many of you are friends with one of these folks Now we re talking We have grown up connected In a survey asking millennials around the world what defines our identity the most popular answer wasn t nationality religion or ethnicity it was citizen of the world That s a big deal Every generation expands the circle of people we consider one of us For us it now encompasses the entire world We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever greater numbers from tribes to cities to nations to achieve things we couldn t on our own We get that our greatest opportunities are now global we can be the generation that ends poverty that ends disease We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations but also as a global community But we live in an unstable time There are people left behind by globalization across the world It s hard to care about people in other places if we don t feel good about our lives here at home There s pressure to turn inwards This is the struggle of our time The forces of freedom openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism isolationism and nationalism Forces for the flow of knowledge trade and immigration against those who would slow them down This is not a battle of nations it s a battle of ideas There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it This isn t going to be decided at the UN either It s going to happen at the local level when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now We all get meaning from our communities Whether our communities are houses or sports teams churches or a cappella groups they give us that sense we are part of something bigger that we are not alone they give us the strength to expand our horizons That s why it s so striking that for decades membership in all kinds of groups has declined as much as one quarter That s a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already are I met Agnes Igoye who s graduating today Where are you Agnes She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones with human trafficking in Uganda and now she trains thousands of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain graduating today too Stand up Kayla and Niha started a non profit that connects people suffering from chronic illnesses with people in their communities willing to help I met David Razu Aznar graduating from the Kennedy School today David stand up He s a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first Latin American city to pass marriage equality even before San Francisco This is my story too A student in a dorm room connecting one community at a time and keeping at it until one day we connect the whole world Change starts local Even global changes start small with people like us In our generation the struggle of whether we connect more whether we achieve our biggest opportunities comes down to this your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose Class of 2017 you are graduating into a world that needs purpose It s up to you to create it Now you may be thinking can I really do this Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club One day after class I was talking to them about college and one of my top students raised his hand and said he wasn t sure he could go because he s undocumented He didn t know if they d let him in Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday I wanted to get him a present so I asked him and he started talking about students he saw struggling and said You know I d really just like a book on social justice I was blown away Here s a young guy who has every reason to be cynical He didn t know if the country he calls home the only one he s known would deny him his dream of going to college But he wasn t feeling sorry for himself He wasn t even thinking of himself He has a greater sense of purpose and he s going to bring people along with him It says something about our current situation that I can t even say his name because I don t want to put him at risk But if a high school senior who doesn t know what the future holds can do his part to move the world forward then we owe it to the world to do our part too Before you walk out those gates one last time as we sit in front of Memorial Church I am reminded of a prayer Mi Shebeirach that I say whenever I face a challenge that I sing to my daughter thinking about her future when I tuck her into bed It goes  May the source of strength who blessed the ones before us help us find the courage to make our lives a blessing I hope you find the courage to make your life a blessing Congratulations Class of 17 Good luck out there '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-010', 'content': ' Speaker 1 It it s an incredibly big deal that Facebook is is completely overhauling its mission and and has a new mission So what is that new mission of Facebook   So our new mission is to bring the world closer together And for the last decade our mission has been to make the world more open and connected 00 00 30 And we ve been really focused on these ideas giving everyone a voice and helping to connect people especially with their friends and family And I feel like those are really good things and we re going to keep going them All right We re definitely not done with that mission yet But now I I just feel like we have a responsibility to do more in the world Right I mean when you look at the world today um giving people a voice and helping people connect are are good and they ve made the world better in a lot of ways but our society is still very divided Right And that means uh that people need to work proactively 00 01 00 to help bring people closer together It s not just enough um to help us simply connect Um we need to work to bring the world closer together  Speaker 1 You ve always had such an interesting uh Utopian view of things And it and it seems like this mission now uh looking forward is something a little bit like Facebook s grown up   Yeah Well when I look at the greatest opportunities and challenges for our generation Right So things like ending poverty or curing diseases or stopping climate change um those are things that no one group or country 00 01 30 can do by themselves Right So we have to build a world where people can come together to take on these big meaningful efforts and you know that change just isn t going to happen top down Right There s no one in the world who can just snap their fingers and and make that happen  Speaker 1 Yeah   So what we need to do is empower uh people all around the world to build communities um things like church groups and sports teams and uh neighborhood groups and groups for people who love dogs and new moms and dads You know that s the Those are the the groups that actually bring people together And once 00 02 00 people are are coming together at these smaller um smaller groups um that actually grows and and it ends up with with much bigger changes in the world  Speaker 1 So how exactly do you do that   If what you re trying to do is is run a group that has thousands of people um you need tools to help manage that So that s a lot of what we re announcing today and we have 300 of the people here who have built the strongest communities on Facebook You know one of the women here uh her her name is Lola She she started the secret group on Facebook called Female IN I don t know if you ve heard 00 02 30 of this  Speaker 1 Mm hmm affirmative laughs   Um she started it She describes it as uh a no judgment support group for women to talk about whatever issues matter the most to them Right So whether it s issues in their marriage or uh in their job or um health or anything And what she s found is that people come and start talking about basic issues but then um it actually has given people an outlet for some really important things too So you know now sometimes women come and and talk about domestic violence And within minutes she says that 00 03 00 uh people get thousands of messages of support uh offers of places to stay and uh help with childcare And you know she didn t start off trying to build a community that was going to change the culture around domestic violence But when you start bringing people together and giving people a way to connect uh that s the kind of thing that this can lead to So that s what we want to try to unlock in the world And our view is if we can help build those tools and give more people like Lola in the world the power to build more of those communities the world is going to be a much better place  Speaker 1 Take 00 03 30 me inside  s head to like the moment that you decided you needed to change Facebook s core mission Uh was there an event that happened or was there just a moment that you said We got to change something   Well for most of the last ten years this idea that the world should be more connected was not very controversial Right And now I think there are starting to be some people who question whether that is good So just been this evolution where where for me and for a lot of the people I work with at Facebook 00 04 00 um you know we feel like giving people a voice is a really important thing to do But it s not enough to just give people a voice you also have to you know help build common ground Right So that way um people can can move forward together and um and aren t just you know sharing a lot of different opinions but you actually have to help reconcile that So that way um people can can come together as well And you know that s a lot of uh the responsibility that we feel now and uh the mission that we want to take on for the next ten years of the company  Speaker 1 We keep hearing We ve never been more divided    00 04 30 Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1  We ve never been more polarized Was it the political climate that that led to kind of this awakening   I think it s really this feeling that simply connecting the world is not enough by itself that you also have to work and do proactive work to help bring people closer together Right So you need to give people voice uh so we can get a diversity of opinions out there but you also need to do work to help build enough common group so that way uh we can make progress as a society together Right You want to help people uh stay connected with 00 05 00 the people they already know and care about but you also want to make it so that people get access to new people and and new perspectives too So we re going to keep on doing everything that we were doing before to connect friends and family and and to help people share But now we also want to uh help people build communities right and and other ways that they can connect and help people bond and come together and spread tolerance and a lot of the values that I think we all want to see in the world  Speaker 1 So let me ask you how you how you do that Because technology to a degree has always   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1  promised to help us discover and to help us 00 05 30 learn There s also the question of like does it make us more insular and is you know is information being hijacked and spread So as you make the future of Facebook these communities how do you make sure they remain a place for authenticity and for for real discourse   People are connecting over something that they have in common And there s a lot of research that shows that if you want to engage on issues that you disagree on right so things that society is divided on the first thing that you need to do is connect over your common humanity Right 00 06 00 So and that can be something as simple as you know we both have families or uh we both like a TV show together or we both like the Chicago Cubs or whatever it is Um so bringing people together and and creating these communities is I think a a lot of what uh we can do to help create uh more civil and productive debate on some of the bigger issues as well  Speaker 1 What have you had to kind of learn from the spread of misinformation Or what have you learned to make sure   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1  that people can really connect    00 06 30 Yeah I mean the the biggest thing that I ve learned as I ve traveled around is that great communities have great leaders who are engaged and who just feel an ownership of uh you know taking care of the people in their groups So one of the things that I think that we can do is just empower leaders and all these folks who want to start communities around the world to do this  Speaker 1 You ve spent um a good amount of time traveling around the country sitting at the dinner table with folks in Ohio Indiana   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1  going to to factories Are we as 00 07 00 divided as as it seem   On some political issues I think we are but on more thing uh than are usually covered we are not Right I mean people have a lot of the same interests Right I mean a lot of people like uh like the same sports teams you know and bond over the same things in their neighborhoods We we all kind of want the same things uh for our families and the people that we care about And one of the things that has been really inspiring to me as I ve gone around is I I ve 00 07 30 seen people who you know I might disagree with on different things but you really come away with this feeling that people genuinely do care about helping and um and caring for other people And you know that that just gives me a lot of faith  Speaker 1 So Facebook is nearing 2 billion users   Mm hmm affirmative  Speaker 1 So how do you ensure for the next billion users that Facebook is a good place for democracy   We want to give everyone in the world a a voice to express what matters to them right and help uh bring people together to be able to solve important challenges One of the big things that I think 00 08 00 that we need to do is just help connect the half of the world that s not on the Internet um to the Internet I mean that sounds like a very basic thing and you and I probably take that for granted because we ve had the Internet for a while But you know for a lot of people in a lot of parts of the world just having access to share your opinion or um send a message to uh your partner or your friend or um learn what the prices are for products at the market uh look up basic jobs I mean those are important things that a lot of people don t have an equal opportunity and access 00 08 30 to do So And there are a lot of things that we can do to to solve this a Facebook Uh we re building technology like solar powered planes to beam down Internet access to uh places that might be remote islands or in the middle of a rainforest Um we re working on new business models with operators to do this But this remains one of the things um that I m most excited about for the next decade and beyond is um just unlocking access to the Internet for the next 3 or 4 billion people and I think if we can do that all these folks who who today don t have the tools to um you know start businesses 00 09 00 or create new tools uh they ll now be able to make our lives better too And and that s going to be a very powerful thing '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2017-011', 'content': '  Today at the Facebook Communities Summit we changed our mission to focus on bringing the world closer together I ve been thinking about this idea for a long time I started talking about it in my community letter and at Harvard Commencement and today I shared the most complete explanation of what we re going to focus on for the next decade Thank you for all your work building community and bringing people together Bringing the World Closer TogetherHey everyone Thanks for coming out to our first ever Facebook Community Summit It s great to be here in Chicago where there s so much great work building community Before we get started I want to introduce myself I m Mark and I m a member of the Zuckerberg family group I m also a member of Max s Circle which is like our family group except we all just share cute photos of my daughter doing ridiculous things I m a member of five groups for people who like the same kind of dog That s my dog His name is Beast He s a Puli He s basically a walking mop except he makes things dirtier not cleaner And it turns out there are thousands of dogs just like him Not that many people know this but I m also an admin of a group for people who love the game Civilization I have to screen a bunch of requests from people who don t actually play the game so I know what you all go through Some communities are more serious We created a group to support my dad who is recovering from heart surgery Dad if you re watching this we re all sending you love and praying for a quick recovery I ll see you when I m back home in a few days All of you with us today have built some of the strongest communities on Facebook You ve built communities for new moms and dads for helping kids get into college One of the leaders here today Derek Hooker runs a group of locksmiths Derek where are you Being a locksmith can be lonely so your group gives them a sense of community And when your members heard we were hosting a community summit dozens of them wrote us saying we had to invite you I m glad you re here with us As I ve sat down with some of you I keep hearing the same themes You ve all been thrust into unexpected leadership positions You started a group you care about and now thousands of people depend on you to keep that community strong I can relate to this I started Facebook to connect my college I always thought one day someone would connect the whole world but I never thought it would be us I would have settled for connecting my whole dorm We were just college kids But we cared so much about this idea that all people want to connect So we just kept pushing forward day by day just like you Another thing that impressed me is you re not running these groups because it s going to look good on your resume You re doing it because you care about bringing people together A few weeks ago I met Lola Omolola Where are you Lola Lola lives in Chicago and is originally from Nigeria Two years ago Lola founded a secret group called Female IN She describes it as a no judgement support group to give women a safe place to talk about everything from marriage to health issues to work problems Today it has more than a million members around the world all women because one woman cared about giving them a voice You see we re all here trying to do the most good for our communities with what we ve been given We know how lucky we are and how much we owe it to our communities to give back And today I want to share with you that we re close to a milestone for our community This morning I was talking to the woman in charge of growing our community Naomi Gleit she ll be here with us tomorrow And talking about stories of leadership Naomi joined us more than 10 years ago right out of college and has worked her way up to leading this big part of Facebook This morning we re talking and she says Mark we re getting close to our community reaching 2 billion people Can you believe that It s a great milestone but it also means we now have an even greater responsibility Every day I say to myself I don t have much time here on Earth how can I make the greatest positive impact I know a lot of you ask yourselves the same question It s not always an easy question to answer Some days I wake up and I just want to be with my daughter and teach her about the world Some nights I go to bed and I m not sure I made the right choices that day I can tell you those doubts don t go away no matter who you are But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better Right now I think the most important thing we can do is bring people closer together It s so important that we re going to change Facebook s whole mission to take this on For the past decade we ve focused on making the world more open and connected We re not done with that But I used to think that if we just gave people a voice and helped them connect that would make the world better by itself In many ways it has But our society is still divided Now I believe we have a responsibility to do even more It s not enough to simply connect the world we must also work to bring the world closer together We need to give people a voice to get a diversity of opinions out there but we also need to build enough common ground so we can all make progress together We need to stay connected with people we already know and care about but we also need to meet new people with new perspectives We need support from family and friends but we also need to build communities to support us as well For the past 10 years our mission has been to make the world more open and connected We will always work to give people a voice and help us stay connected but now we will do even more Today we re expanding our mission to set our course for the next 10 years The idea for our new mission is bring the world closer together Our full mission statement is give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together That reflects that we can t do this ourselves but only by empowering people to build communities and bring people together Our lives are all connected In the next generation our greatest opportunities and challenges we can only take on together ending poverty curing disease stopping climate change spreading freedom and tolerance stopping terrorism No single group or even country can do that alone We have to build a world where people come together to take on these big meaningful efforts This isn t going to happen top down There s no one in the world who can snap their fingers and make this happen People have to want it Change starts local when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and support in our own lives that we can start caring about broader issues too I always believed people are basically good As I ve traveled around I ve met all kinds of people from regular folks to heads of state and I ve found they almost all genuinely care about helping people But I ve also found we all need to feel supported We don t want to feel afraid But when we don t feel good about lives here at home it s hard to care about people in other places Communities give us that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves that we are not alone that we have something better ahead to work for We all get meaning from our communities Whether they re churches sports teams or neighborhood groups they give us the strength to expand our horizons and care about broader issues Studies have proven the more connected we are the happier we feel and the healthier we are People who go to church are more likely to volunteer and give to charity not just because they re religious but because they re part of a community That s why it s so striking that for decades membership in all kinds of groups has declined as much as one quarter That s a lot of of people who now need to find a sense of purpose and support somewhere else This is our challenge We have to build a world where everyone has a sense of purpose and community That s how we ll bring the world closer together We have to build a world where we care about a person in India or China or Nigeria or Mexico as much as a person here That s how we ll achieve our greatest opportunities and build the world we want for generations to come I know we can do this We can reverse this decline rebuild our communities start new ones and bring the whole world closer together So how are we going to do this Today we re going to talk about two parts of our product roadmap focused on building Meaningful Communities Most of us are part of a lot of groups in the physical world and online The average person on Facebook is a member of about 30 groups but if you re lucky you may have one or two that are really important to you The rest are casual groups like the Puli ones I m in where I get some cute puppy photos And those are important too but they re not exactly part of my social support structure We found more than 100 million people are members of what they call meaningful communities These are groups that upon joining quickly become the most important part of your social network experience and an important part of your real world support structure If you re diagnosed with a rare disease you can join a group and connect with people with that condition all around the world so you re not alone If you re a new parent you can join a group and get support from other new mothers and fathers These communities don t just interact online They hold get togethers organize dinners and support each other in their daily lives Online communities strengthen physical communities by helping people come together online as well as offline even across great distances So I started asking the question if 2 billion people use Facebook then how come we ve only helped 100 million of them join meaningful communities Well it turns out most people don t seek out communities in the physical world or online Either your friends invite you or on Facebook we suggest them for you So we started a project to see if we could get better at suggesting groups that will be meaningful to you We started building artificial intelligence to do this And it works In the first 6 months we helped 50 more people join meaningful communities And there s a lot more to do here So now we re setting a goal to help one billion people join meaningful communities If we can do this it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we ve seen for decades it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together But AI can only get us so far because in order to suggest meaningful communities there have to be communities for you to join in the first place And that s why you the community leaders are so important to this mission As I ve traveled around and learned about different places one theme is clear every great community has great leaders Think about it A church doesn t just come together It has a pastor who cares for the well being of their congregation makes sure they have food and shelter A little league team has a coach who motivates the kids and helps them hit better Leaders set the culture inspire us give us a safety net and look out for us Every one of you does this for your communities That s why your groups mean so much to your members One of the most impressive communities I ve seen is the military On one of my visits they shared a leadership principle I ll never forget They call it 100 ownership If they have 5 people on a team each person isn t just responsible for one fifth of the problem Every person is responsible for 100 of the mission I ve tried to bring this to Facebook We have a saying nothing at Facebook is someone else s problem If you see something wrong you go fix it You all embody this spirit for your communities You ve said nothing is someone else s problem when it comes to looking out for your members Laurie McMonigle is here Where are you Laurie Laurie runs a group for disabled veterans that fills gaps our government misses One veteran who was about to have his electricity shut off posted in the group asking for help and members came together to help him pay his bills Pamela Radisek is here too Where are you Pamela Pamela runs a group called I Am Adopted Your group helps adopted children find their birth parents and the group members have helped reunite a number of families Great communities have great leaders If we want the world to be filled with communities like the ones you re all building we need to give more leaders the power to build communities like you Historically that s not how we ve set up groups on Facebook Groups have been pretty flat where everyone is a peer and that makes sense when you re talking about a family group that doesn t really have a leader But it doesn t make sense when you re trying to run a group with thousands of people Matt Prestbury is here Where are you Matt Matt runs a group for black fathers out of Baltimore Matt you told me you spend a couple hours a day starting discussions and approving or denying every post and membership request himself on top of your regular job as a preschool teacher One of you told me your husband often comes home from work and can tell you ve been working on the couch in the living room since the morning which I can relate to by the way All of you make sacrifices for your communities because you believe in what you re doing And I want you to know we believe in what you re doing too So today we re going to start rolling out new tools to make it easier for you to build communities There s a clear roadmap here like what we ve done with Page and Events admins First we re going to give you new tools that offer insights into who your members are and how they re engaging insights into things like join requests and the time of day your members are most active So if you run a group for new moms maybe that s 1am and 3am and 5am We re about to have another daughter so I m going to have to get back on that schedule And of course we have new tools for managing new member requests You re going to be able to sort and filter requests by location and gender and group them together so you can accept or decline them all at once That s going to save you a lot of time And we re going to help you remove bad actors and their content quickly to keep a positive and safe environment This is really important In the next couple of days you re going to hear more about our roadmap and our research on what makes meaningful communities Because if we re going to bring the world closer together we need to support people like you who are already doing it And we need to give that power to more people too When you bring people together you never know where it will lead Remember when I told you about Lola s women s support group that now has 1 million members around the world When I sat down with Lola she told me for some girls growing up in Nigeria if you talk out of turn your mom will pinch you and tell you to be quiet You start to feel like there s something wrong with you if you speak up Now her community is helping break this culture of silence and it s having unexpected consequences on issues like domestic violence Lola told me that for some Nigerian women like her this silence results in them enduring abuse But now when someone posts about it in the group they get thousands of messages of support offers of places to stay and childcare within minutes Lola didn t start out trying to change the culture of domestic violence around the world She just wanted to give women a place to talk safely about what mattered to them That s the power of the communities you re building You may think you re just creating a space for new moms or bird watchers or locksmiths But when you give people a way to connect and a sense of support it can lead to important changes We all have the power to be leaders And if enough of us work to build community and bring people closer together we just might change the world Thank you for coming out today Thank you so much for all you do for your communities and for the world It s an honor to be on this mission with you and I m looking forward to doing this together '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-041', 'content': '  I know a lot of us are thinking about how we can make the most positive impact in the world right now I wrote this letter about how I hope we can come together to build a global community that works for everyone Building Global CommunityTo our community On our journey to connect the world we often discuss products we re building and updates on our business Today I want to focus on the most important question of all are we building the world we all want History is the story of how we ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers from tribes to cities to nations At each step we built social infrastructure like communities media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn t on our own Today we are close to taking our next step Our greatest opportunities are now global like spreading prosperity and freedom promoting peace and understanding lifting people out of poverty and accelerating science Our greatest challenges also need global responses like ending terrorism fighting climate change and preventing pandemics Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations but also as a global community This is especially important right now Facebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community When we began this idea was not controversial Every year the world got more connected and this was seen as a positive trend Yet now across the world there are people left behind by globalization and movements for withdrawing from global connection There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology We always overestimate what we can do in two years and we underestimate what we can do in ten years We may not have the power to create the world we want immediately but we can all start working on the long term today In times like these the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us For the past decade Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families With that foundation our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community for supporting us for keeping us safe for informing us for civic engagement and for inclusion of all Bringing us all together as a global community is a project bigger than any one organization or company but Facebook can help contribute to answering these five important questions How do we help people build supportive communities that strengthen traditional institutions in a world where membership in these institutions is declining How do we help people build a safe community that prevents harm helps during crises and rebuilds afterwards in a world where anyone across the world can affect us How do we help people build an informed community that exposes us to new ideas and builds common understanding in a world where every person has a voice How do we help people build a civically engaged community in a world where participation in voting sometimes includes less than half our population How do we help people build an inclusive community that reflects our collective values and common humanity from local to global levels spanning cultures nations and regions in a world with few examples of global communities My hope is that more of us will commit our energy to building the long term social infrastructure to bring humanity together The answers to these questions won t all come from Facebook but I believe we can play a role Our job at Facebook is to help people make the greatest positive impact while mitigating areas where technology and social media can contribute to divisiveness and isolation Facebook is a work in progress and we are dedicated to learning and improving We take our responsibility seriously and today I want to talk about how we plan to do our part to build this global community Supportive CommunitiesBuilding a global community that works for everyone starts with the millions of smaller communities and intimate social structures we turn to for our personal emotional and spiritual needs Whether they re churches sports teams unions or other local groups they all share important roles as social infrastructure for our communities They provide all of us with a sense of purpose and hope moral validation that we are needed and part of something bigger than ourselves comfort that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us mentorship guidance and personal development a safety net values cultural norms and accountability social gatherings rituals and a way to meet new people and a way to pass time In our society we have personal relationships with friends and family and then we have institutional relationships with the governments that set the rules A healthy society also has many layers of communities between us and government that take care of our needs When we refer to our social fabric we usually mean the many mediating groups that bring us together and reinforce our values However there has been a striking decline in the important social infrastructure of local communities over the past few decades Since the 1970s membership in some local groups has declined by as much as one quarter cutting across all segments of the population The decline raises deeper questions alongside surveys showing large percentages of our population lack a sense of hope for the future It is possible many of our challenges are at least as much social as they are economic related to a lack of community and connection to something greater than ourselves As one pastor told me People feel unsettled A lot of what was settling in the past doesn t exist anymore Online communities are a bright spot and we can strengthen existing physical communities by helping people come together online as well as offline In the same way connecting with friends online strengthens real relationships developing this infrastructure will strengthen these communities as well as enable completely new ones to form A woman named Christina was diagnosed with a rare disorder called Epidermolysis Bullosa and now she s a member of a group that connects 2 400 people around the world so none of them have to suffer alone A man named Matt was raising his two sons by himself and he started the Black Fathers group to help men share advice and encouragement as they raise their families In San Diego more than 4 000 military family members are part of a group that helps them make friends with other spouses These communities don t just interact online They hold get togethers organize dinners and support each other in their daily lives We recently found that more than 100 million people on Facebook are members of what we call very meaningful groups These are groups that upon joining quickly become the most important part of our social network experience and an important part of our physical support structure For example many new parents tell us that joining a parenting group after having a child fits this purpose There is a real opportunity to connect more of us with groups that will be meaningful social infrastructure in our lives More than one billion people are active members of Facebook groups but most don t seek out groups on their own friends send invites or Facebook suggests them If we can improve our suggestions and help connect one billion people with meaningful communities that can strengthen our social fabric Going forward we will measure Facebook s progress with groups based on meaningful groups not groups overall This will require not only helping people connect with existing meaningful groups but also enabling community leaders to create more meaningful groups for people to connect with The most successful physical communities have engaged leaders and we ve seen the same with online groups as well In Berlin a man named Monis Bukhari runs a group where he personally helps refugees find homes and jobs Today Facebook s tools for group admins are relatively simple We plan to build more tools to empower community leaders like Monis to run and grow their groups the way they d like similar to what we ve done with Pages Most communities are made of many sub communities and this is another clear area for developing new tools A school for example is not a single community but many smaller groups among its classes dorms and student groups Just as the social fabric of society is made up of many communities each community is made of many groups of personal connections We plan to expand groups to support sub communities We can look at many activities through the lens of building community Watching video of our favorite sports team or TV show reading our favorite newspaper or playing our favorite game are not just entertainment or information but a shared experience and opportunity to bring together people who care about the same things We can design these experiences not for passive consumption but for strengthening social connections Our goal is to strengthen existing communities by helping us come together online as well as offline as well as enabling us to form completely new communities transcending physical location When we do this beyond connecting online we reinforce our physical communities by bringing us together in person to support each other A healthy society needs these communities to support our personal emotional and spiritual needs In a world where this physical social infrastructure has been declining we have a real opportunity to help strengthen these communities and the social fabric of our society Safe CommunityAs we build a global community this is a moment of truth Our success isn t just based on whether we can capture videos and share them with friends It s about whether we re building a community that helps keep us safe that prevents harm helps during crises and rebuilds afterwards Today s threats are increasingly global but the infrastructure to protect us is not Problems like terrorism natural disasters disease refugee crises and climate change need coordinated responses from a worldwide vantage point No nation can solve them alone A virus in one nation can quickly spread to others A conflict in one country can create a refugee crisis across continents Pollution in one place can affect the environment around the world Humanity s current systems are insufficient to address these issues Many dedicated people join global non profit organizations to help but the market often fails to fund or incentivize building the necessary infrastructure I have long expected more organizations and startups to build health and safety tools using technology and I have been surprised by how little of what must be built has even been attempted There is a real opportunity to build global safety infrastructure and I have directed Facebook to invest more and more resources into serving this need For some of these problems the Facebook community is in a unique position to help prevent harm assist during a crisis or come together to rebuild afterwards This is because of the amount of communication across our network our ability to quickly reach people worldwide in an emergency and the vast scale of people s intrinsic goodness aggregated across our community To prevent harm we can build social infrastructure to help our community identify problems before they happen When someone is thinking of suicide or hurting themselves we ve built infrastructure to give their friends and community tools that could save their life When a child goes missing we ve built infrastructure to show Amber Alerts and multiple children have been rescued without harm And we ve built infrastructure to work with public safety organizations around the world when we become aware of these issues Going forward there are even more cases where our community should be able to identify risks related to mental health disease or crime To help during a crisis we ve built infrastructure like Safety Check so we can all let our friends know we re safe and check on friends who might be affected by an attack or natural disaster Safety Check has been activated almost 500 times in two years and has already notified people that their families and friends are safe more than a billion times When there is a disaster governments often call us to make sure Safety Check has been activated in their countries But there is more to build We recently added tools to find and offer shelter food and other resources during emergencies Over time our community should be able to help during wars and ongoing issues that are not limited to a single event To rebuild after a crisis we ve built the world s largest social infrastructure for collective action A few years ago after an earthquake in Nepal the Facebook community raised 15 million to help people recover and rebuild which was the largest crowdfunded relief effort in history We saw a similar effort after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando when people across the country organized blood donations to help victims they had never met Similarly we built tools so millions of people could commit to becoming organ donors to save others after accidents and registries reported larger boosts in sign ups than ever before Looking ahead one of our greatest opportunities to keep people safe is building artificial intelligence to understand more quickly and accurately what is happening across our community There are billions of posts comments and messages across our services each day and since it s impossible to review all of them we review content once it is reported to us There have been terribly tragic events like suicides some live streamed that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner There are cases of bullying and harassment every day that our team must be alerted to before we can help out These stories show we must find a way to do more Artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach We are researching systems that can look at photos and videos to flag content our team should review This is still very early in development but we have started to have it look at some content and it already generates about one third of all reports to the team that reviews content for our community It will take many years to fully develop these systems Right now we re starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda so we can quickly remove anyone trying to use our services to recruit for a terrorist organization This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide As we discuss keeping our community safe it is important to emphasize that part of keeping people safe is protecting individual security and liberty We are strong advocates of encryption and have built it into the largest messaging platforms in the world WhatsApp and Messenger Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy Since building end to end encryption into WhatsApp we have reduced spam and malicious content by more than 75 The path forward is to recognize that a global community needs social infrastructure to keep us safe from threats around the world and that our community is uniquely positioned to prevent disasters help during crises and rebuild afterwards Keeping the global community safe is an important part of our mission and an important part of how we ll measure our progress going forward Informed CommunityThe purpose of any community is to bring people together to do things we couldn t do on our own To do this we need ways to share new ideas and share enough common understanding to actually work together Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality It is our responsibility to amplify the good effects and mitigate the bad to continue increasing diversity while strengthening our common understanding so our community can create the greatest positive impact on the world The two most discussed concerns this past year were about diversity of viewpoints we see filter bubbles and accuracy of information fake news I worry about these and we have studied them extensively but I also worry there are even more powerful effects we must mitigate around sensationalism and polarization leading to a loss of common understanding Social media already provides more diverse viewpoints than traditional media ever has Even if most of our friends are like us we all know people with different interests beliefs and backgrounds who expose us to different perspectives Compared with getting our news from the same two or three TV networks or reading the same newspapers with their consistent editorial views our networks on Facebook show us more diverse content But our goal must be to help people see a more complete picture not just alternate perspectives We must be careful how we do this Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas like showing people an article from the opposite perspective actually deepen polarization by framing other perspectives as foreign A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right Over time our community will identify which sources provide a complete range of perspectives so that content will naturally surface more Accuracy of information is very important We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook and we take this very seriously We ve made progress fighting hoaxes the way we fight spam but we have more work to do We are proceeding carefully because there is not always a clear line between hoaxes satire and opinion In a free society it s important that people have the power to share their opinion even if others think they re wrong Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information including that fact checkers dispute an item s accuracy While we have more work to do on information diversity and misinformation I am even more focused on the impact of sensationalism and polarization and the idea of building common understanding Social media is a short form medium where resonant messages get amplified many times This rewards simplicity and discourages nuance At its best this focuses messages and exposes people to different ideas At its worst it oversimplifies important topics and pushes us towards extremes Polarization exists in all areas of discourse not just social media It occurs in all groups and communities including companies classrooms and juries and it s usually unrelated to politics In the tech community for example discussion around AI has been oversimplified to existential fear mongering The harm is that sensationalism moves people away from balanced nuanced opinions towards polarized extremes If this continues and we lose common understanding then even if we eliminated all misinformation people would just emphasize different sets of facts to fit their polarized opinions That s why I m so worried about sensationalism in media Fortunately there are clear steps we can take to correct these effects For example we noticed some people share stories based on sensational headlines without ever reading the story In general if you become less likely to share a story after reading it that s a good sign the headline was sensational If you re more likely to share a story after reading it that s often a sign of good in depth content We recently started reducing sensationalism in News Feed by taking this into account for pieces of content and going forward signals like this will identify sensational publishers as well There are many steps like this we have taken and will keep taking to reduce sensationalism and help build a more informed community Research suggests the best solutions for improving discourse may come from getting to know each other as whole people instead of just opinions something Facebook may be uniquely suited to do If we connect with people about what we have in common sports teams TV shows interests it is easier to have dialogue about what we disagree on When we do this well we give billions of people the ability to share new perspectives while mitigating the unwanted effects that come with any new medium A strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community Giving people a voice is not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it There is more we must do to support the news industry to make sure this vital social function is sustainable from growing local news to developing formats best suited to mobile devices to improving the range of business models news organizations rely on Connecting everyone to the internet is also necessary for building an informed community For the majority of people around the world the debate is not about the quality of public discourse but whether they have access to basic information they need at all often related to health education and jobs Finally I want to emphasize that the vast majority of conversations on Facebook are social not ideological They re friends sharing jokes and families staying in touch across cities They re people finding groups whether they re new parents raising kids or newly diagnosed patients suffering from a disease together Sometimes it s for joy coming together around religion or sports And sometimes it s for survival like refugees communicating to find shelter Whatever your situation when you enter our community our commitment is to continue improving our tools to give you the power to share your experience By increasing the diversity of our ideas and strengthening our common understanding our community can have the greatest positive impact on the world Civically Engaged CommunityOur society will reflect our collective values only if we engage in the civic process and participate in self governance There are two distinct types of social infrastructure that must be built The first encourages engagement in existing political processes voting engaging with issues and representatives speaking out and sometimes organizing Only through dramatically greater engagement can we ensure these political processes reflect our values The second is establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in collective decision making Our world is more connected than ever and we face global problems that span national boundaries As the largest global community Facebook can explore examples of how community governance might work at scale The starting point for civic engagement in the existing political process is to support voting across the world It is striking that only about half of Americans eligible to vote participate in elections This is low compared to other countries but democracy is receding in many countries and there is a large opportunity across the world to encourage civic participation In the United States election last year we helped more than 2 million people register to vote and then go vote This was among the largest voter turnout efforts in history and larger than those of both major parties combined In every election around the world we keep improving our tools to help more people register and vote and we hope to eventually enable hundreds of millions of more people to vote in elections than do today in every democratic country around the world Local civic engagement is a big opportunity as well as national Today most of us do not even know who our local representatives are but many policies impacting our lives are local and this is where our participation has the greatest influence Research suggests reading local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement This shows how building an informed community supportive local communities and a civically engaged community are all related Beyond voting the greatest opportunity is helping people stay engaged with the issues that matter to them every day not just every few years at the ballot box We can help establish direct dialogue and accountability between people and our elected leaders In India Prime Minister Modi has asked his ministers to share their meetings and information on Facebook so they can hear direct feedback from citizens In Kenya whole villages are in WhatsApp groups together including their representatives In recent campaigns around the world from India and Indonesia across Europe to the United States we ve seen the candidate with the largest and most engaged following on Facebook usually wins Just as TV became the primary medium for civic communication in the 1960s social media is becoming this in the 21st century This creates an opportunity for us to connect with our representatives at all levels In the last few months we have already helped our community double the number of connections between people and our representatives by making it easier to connect with all our representatives in one click When we connect we can engage directly in comments and messages For example in Iceland it s common to tag politicians in group discussions so they can take community issues to parliament Sometimes people must speak out and demonstrate for what they believe is right From Tahrir Square to the Tea Party our community organizes these demonstrations using our infrastructure for events and groups On a daily basis people use their voices to share their views in ways that can spread around the world and grow into movements The Women s March is an example of this where a grandmother with an internet connection wrote a post that led her friends to start a Facebook event that eventually turned into millions of people marching in cities around the world Giving people a voice is a principle our community has been committed to since we began As we look ahead to building the social infrastructure for a global community we will work on building new tools that encourage thoughtful civic engagement Empowering us to use our voices will only become more important Inclusive CommunityBuilding an inclusive global community requires establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in community governance I hope that we can explore examples of how collective decision making might work at scale Facebook is not just technology or media but a community of people That means we need Community Standards that reflect our collective values for what should and should not be allowed In the last year the complexity of the issues we ve seen has outstripped our existing processes for governing the community We saw this in errors taking down newsworthy videos related to Black Lives Matter and police violence and in removing the historical Terror of War photo from Vietnam We ve seen this in misclassifying hate speech in political debates in both directions taking down accounts and content that should be left up and leaving up content that was hateful and should be taken down Both the number of issues and their cultural importance has increased recently This has been painful for me because I often agree with those criticizing us that we re making mistakes These mistakes are almost never because we hold ideological positions at odds with the community but instead are operational scaling issues Our guiding philosophy for the Community Standards is to try to reflect the cultural norms of our community When in doubt we always favor giving people the power to share more There are a few reasons for the increase in issues we ve seen cultural norms are shifting cultures are different around the world and people are sensitive to different things First our community is evolving from its origin connecting us with family and friends to now becoming a source of news and public discourse as well With this cultural shift our Community Standards must adapt to permit more newsworthy and historical content even if some is objectionable For example an extremely violent video of someone dying would have been marked as disturbing and taken down However now that we use Live to capture the news and we post videos to protest violence our standards must adapt Similarly a photo depicting any child nudity would have always been taken down and for good reason but we ve now adapted our standards to allow historically important content like the Terror of War photo These issues reflect a need to update our standards to meet evolving expectations from our community Second our community spans many countries and cultures and the norms are different in each region It s not surprising that Europeans more frequently find fault with taking down images depicting nudity since some European cultures are more accepting of nudity than for example many communities in the Middle East or Asia With a community of almost two billion people it is less feasible to have a single set of standards to govern the entire community so we need to evolve towards a system of more local governance Third even within a given culture we have different opinions on what we want to see and what is objectionable I may be okay with more politically charged speech but not want to see anything sexually suggestive while you may be okay with nudity but not want to see offensive speech Similarly you may want to share a violent video in a protest without worrying that you re going to bother friends who don t want to see it And just as it s a bad experience to see objectionable content it s also a terrible experience to be told we can t share something we feel is important This suggests we need to evolve towards a system of personal control over our experience Fourth we re operating at such a large scale that even a small percent of errors causes a large number of bad experiences We review over one hundred million pieces of content every month and even if our reviewers get 99 of the calls right that s still millions of errors over time Any system will always have some mistakes but I believe we can do better than we are today I ve spent a lot of time over the past year reflecting on how we can improve our community governance Sitting here in California we re not best positioned to identify the cultural norms around the world Instead we need a system where we can all contribute to setting the standards Although this system is not fully developed I want to share an idea of how this might work The guiding principles are that the Community Standards should reflect the cultural norms of our community that each person should see as little objectionable content as possible and each person should be able to share what they want while being told they cannot share something as little as possible The approach is to combine creating a large scale democratic process to determine standards with AI to help enforce them The idea is to give everyone in the community options for how they would like to set the content policy for themselves Where is your line on nudity On violence On graphic content On profanity What you decide will be your personal settings We will periodically ask you these questions to increase participation and so you don t need to dig around to find them For those who don t make a decision the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected like a referendum Of course you will always be free to update your personal settings anytime With a broader range of controls content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow Within that range content should simply not be shown to anyone whose personal controls suggest they would not want to see it or at least they should see a warning first Although we will still block content based on standards and local laws our hope is that this system of personal controls and democratic referenda should minimize restrictions on what we can share It s worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech graphic violence sexually explicit content and more At our current pace of research we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017 but others will not be possible for many years Overall it is important that the governance of our community scales with the complexity and demands of its people We are committed to always doing better even if that involves building a worldwide voting system to give you more voice and control Our hope is that this model provides examples of how collective decision making may work in other aspects of the global community This is an important time in the development of our global community and it s a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact History has had many moments like today As we ve made our great leaps from tribes to cities to nations we have always had to build social infrastructure like communities media and governments for us to thrive and reach the next level At each step we learned how to come together to solve our challenges and accomplish greater things than we could alone We have done it before and we will do it again I am reminded of President Lincoln s remarks during the American Civil War We can succeed only by concert It is not can any of us imagine better but can we all do better The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion As our case is new so we must think anew act anew There are many of us who stand for bringing people together and connecting the world I hope we have the focus to take the long view and build the new social infrastructure to create the world we want for generations to come It s an honor to be on this journey with you Thank you for being part of this community and thanks for everything you do to make the world more open and connected Mark'}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-097', 'content': '  Priscilla and I spent the day in Millinocket Maine hiking on the Appalachian Trail around Mount Katahdin and meeting local residents former mill workers teachers small business owners a librarian and a trucker Forest based industries like lumber and paper were the lifeblood of this region for generations but trade lower cost imports from Canada and technology synthetic wood alternatives have forced mills across the region to close and thousands of jobs to be lost Millinocket was literally built around a paper mill The mill company supported the schools built homes for workers and at the end of the day just took care of everyone People graduating from high school knew they had a job at the mill if they wanted it But as a result of having such stable opportunities the people we met told us they worry the region lacks the entrepreneurial spirit it needs to revitalize the economy One teacher told us his biggest challenge was to get his students to see what new kinds of opportunities might even look like Some former mill workers told us they hoped the jobs they were now going back to school to train for would still be around in five years so they wouldn t be laid off again A couple of people mentioned they were worried about what jobs their children should get that wouldn t be easily automated in the future Although some people like the truck driver we met felt very confident their jobs wouldn t be too affected by automation during their careers Despite all the challenges I was struck by their commitment to rebuild their community When I asked people if they would leave to pursue a better career opportunity elsewhere not a single person said they would They love their community and they re optimistic they can build new industries not cutting down the forests but leaving them standing and creating tourism from the natural beauty as well as other industries of the future If the couple who built the bed and breakfast we stayed at by hand are an example of the spirit of this area then I m confident they ll succeed As I ve traveled to different states this year I ve been thinking about common themes in the issues we re facing I ll try to post some reflections on that in the next few days '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2017-098', 'content': '  My personal challenge this year is to visit every state I haven t spent time in before to learn about people s hopes and challenges and how they re thinking about their work and communities After my early trips people asked me what I was learning but I wanted to be careful not to generalize because every state is so different I have a lot more to learn but I m starting to see some common threads My biggest takeaway so far is that our relationships shape us more than we think how we consider opportunities how we process information and how we form habits There is a lot of discussion about inequality but one under looked dimension of inequality is in the makeup of our social networks There s a widely held myth that if people in other places just had better information they d make better decisions I ve found this is generally wrong and the people I ve met are rational Now it s true we re all missing some information that would help us make better decisions no matter where we live But the people I ve met have good reasons for the decisions they make based on their experiences and those of their friends and family The more fundamental issue seems to be the friends and family we surround ourselves with This is a powerful force upstream of the information we receive and it determines how we process and factor it into our decisions I ll share three stories about how our relationships affect very different social problems First story I was in Ohio and sat down with recovering heroin addicts They told me the first step in fighting addiction is to detox but the second is to get completely new friends If you stay friends with the people you were using with or even with people who are using on their own you re almost guaranteed to relapse It s tough when those people are your close friends and even tougher when they re your family but building new relationships is the most important predictor of staying clean This isn t a matter of information These recovering addicts all know heroin is bad for them and they know they shouldn t use it But the people around you are a much stronger influence than information So to move forward we need to operate on the level of helping people build better relationships not just getting them information Second story I was in Indiana at a juvenile justice center Some of the kids had committed serious crimes like murder or robbery but others had just misbehaved in class The most striking fact is that those kids are more likely to become criminals after going through detention than they were before they went in The correctional system is building a negative and self reinforcing social network Similar to the first story these kids know crime is bad and they don t want to go to prison But we all model our behavior on people around us If we want to help them we should help these kids build positive relationships with role models Third story This one is about economic upward mobility When I was driving through some depressed areas in the south I was struck by how few people move to seek better opportunities elsewhere It turns out there s good research showing how a lot of economic inequality comes from our lack of willingness or ability to move geographically See Raj Chetty s work here equality of opportunity org neighborhoods From my conversations a lot of people s decisions about whether to move depend on their friends and family in a couple of ways First if you grow up in a place where all your friends and family move away for college or to seek a job then that sets an example for you The reverse is also true and if all your friends and family stay home that sets a norm too Second and perhaps stronger if all your friends and family move away for opportunities there is less reason to stay where you grew up On the other hand if all your friends and family stay in the same place there is a strong pull back home I ve heard lots of stories of people who went away to college but when they had kids they needed help and since childcare is so expensive they moved back home to be closer to their family Coming home has great advantages but if you don t have a diversity of friends and family who can expose you to different things that may limit your ability to find opportunity I ve seen lots of more stories like the three above that point to your friends and family as the most powerful force in shaping your path including positive ones In Detroit I met community leaders who turned an abandoned building into a safe place where kids can hang out after school The founder told me We want kids to be able to think again and that comes from seeing men and women who care about what they do We ve got whole neighborhoods of kids just waiting for someone to give them a sense of purpose This isn t a scientific study and it requires further research but I think there s something to this idea that your relationships shape your path more than we realize I also think this is an area where Facebook can make a difference Some of you have asked if this challenge means I m running for public office I m not I m doing it to get a broader perspective to make sure we re best serving our community of almost 2 billion people at Facebook and doing the best work to promote equal opportunity at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative In many ways relationships are the most important things in our lives whether we re trying to form healthy habits stay out of trouble or find better opportunities And yet research shows the average American has fewer than three close friends we can turn to for support Facebook has been focused on helping you connect with people you already know We ve built AI systems to recommend People You May Know But it might be just as important to also connect you with people you should know mentors and people outside your circle who care about you and can provide a new source of support and inspiration There are a number of models for how this might work The Peace Corps creates service opportunities where people exchange culture and build new relationships Perhaps we could build a new digital peace corps Another model is Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous where people who have struggled with these challenges and overcome them go on to become mentors for others with the hope of training them to one day become mentors themselves This is something I ve only recently started studying and working with our teams at Facebook to build One thing I ve been inspired by is that if we can just help a few percent of people that can make a huge positive impact on our society overall On the unfortunate side even though only a few percent of people are addicted to opioids we all know someone affected by this But that also means that if we can just help a few percent of people build new positive relationships that will affect all of us as well That gives me hope that we can do this My hope is that we can help more people build positive relationships with people who expand their sense of possibility I believe that if we do this we will make progress on a lot of our greatest opportunities and challenges I hope a lot of you have challenged yourselves to get out and learn from other perspectives this year too I d love to hear your stories and reflections as well '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-138', 'content': '  Today I visited the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and its capital in Browning Montana The reservation is a microcosm of how the pillars of a fair government strong economy and healthy community are all connected The Blackfeet have been on this land for 10 000 years and for most of that time they followed the buffalo for food shelter and clothing Then settlers came took their land through war and implemented programs that made the Blackfeet dependent on the state The chairman told me they ripped the pride out of our chests and back filled it with alcohol The US government forced the the Blackfeet to adopt a tribal council government which lacks checks and balances that are important for maintaining a fair society like independent courts In this system judges report to the council and are fireable This has led to corruption where people who know council members can often avoid being charged or convicted of crimes Without a fair government the economy can t thrive When outside businesses invest and for example try to collect payment from members of the tribe they find the courts always rule in favor of tribal members This creates a massive disincentive for people to invest or start new businesses which in turn reduces opportunity and jobs The result is a feeling of helplessness I asked what the last new business in town was and they told me about a fabric store that opened five years ago The last major industrial development was a pencil factory that closed in 1981 Of their relatively low employment more than 70 of jobs are working for the government One person told me they ve lost confidence in their ability to build businesses The lack of fair governance and economic growth has also contributed to poor community health On the Blackfeet reservation drug and alcohol abuse are rampant More than a quarter of babies are born dependent on drugs from drug addicted mothers 50 of 196 babies born in the last year That has further negative effects on those children s ability to learn and contribute to the economy The life expectancy here is 20 years less than our national average With poverty and poor access to quality food they struggle with the dual issues of starvation and obesity Even the chairman of the tribe had some of his toes amputated as a result of diabetes One difficult dynamic I ve noticed is that areas with weaker economies and more health issues need social services for more of their citizens but can afford them less These areas have smaller tax bases from fewer working people compared to a larger number of unemployed people they have to support By contrast wealthier areas with more working and healthy people have larger tax bases and fewer people to support This just shows how important strong economic growth is for providing social services and how important it is to set up these services well to give people the dignity and confidence to be entrepreneurial rather than making them feel helpless and dependent A lot of what I saw comes back to the basic idea of freedom If people have the freedom to do what they want whether that s taking a chance on a new idea or building their community the inherent creativity and goodness in people will help different parts of society flourish But the rule of law strong economies and community health are all related When we impose unfair systems it is easy to get in the way and push everything out of balance When I asked the Blackfeet leaders what will help change this they talked about self reliance They want to get back to supporting themselves and controlling the land they ve lived on for thousands of years They re winning some battles The tribe recently won a fight to prevent the US government giving an oil company rights to land that plays an important part in the tribe s origin story But that fight took 30 years and that time could have been spent growing their economy in other ways They also recently won control of 90 of the water on the reservation which they want to bottle and sell but right now that s just a plan Some of their hope still comes from the buffalo They recently started a new herd and now have more than 700 It s a source of pride and self reliance and a symbol that things are changing Last month the tribe even took a vote on whether to change the tribal council government structure It failed by a few hundred votes but they aren t giving up For thousands of years personal freedom was a way of life for the Blackfeet Now they ll fight until they get it back Thanks to the Blackfeet for hosting me today I m confident things will keep improving as they get the personal freedom they and all people strive for '}\n",

democracy That s not what we stand for The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world That s why we ve built teams dedicated to working on election integrity and preventing governments from interfering in the elections of other nations And as we ve shared before our teams have found and shut down thousands of fake accounts that could be attempting to influence elections in many countries including recently in the French elections Now I wish I could tell you we re going to be able to stop all interference but that wouldn t be realistic There will always be

interference We have been investigating this for many months and for a while we had found no evidence of fake accounts linked to Russia running ads When we recently uncovered this activity we provided that information to the special counsel We also briefed Congress and this morning I directed our team to provide the ads we ve found to Congress as well As a general rule we are limited in what we can discuss publicly about law enforcement investigations so we may not always be able to share our findings publicly But we support Congress in deciding how to best use this information to inform the public and we expect the government to publish its findings when their investigation is complete 2 We will continue our investigation into what happened on Facebook in this election We may find more and if we do we will continue to work with the government We are looking into foreign actors including additional Russian groups and other former Soviet states as well as organizations like the campaigns to further our understanding of how they used our tools These investigations will take some time but we will continue our thorough review 3 Going forward and perhaps the most important step we re taking we re going to make political advertising more transparent When someone buys political ads on TV or other media they re required by law to disclose who paid for them But you still don t know if you re seeing the same messages as everyone else So we re going to bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency Not only will you have to disclose which page paid for an ad but we will also make it so you can visit an advertiser s page and see the ads they re currently running to any audience on Facebook We will roll this out over the coming months and we will work with others to create a new standard for transparency in online political ads 4 We will strengthen our ad review process for political ads To be clear it has always been against our policies to use any of our tools in a way that breaks the law and we already have many controls in place to prevent this But we can do more Most ads are bought programmatically through our apps and website without the advertiser ever speaking to anyone at Facebook That s what happened here But even without our employees involved in the sales we can do better Now I m not going to sit here and tell you we re going to catch all bad content in our system We don t check what people say before they say it and frankly I don t think our society should want us to Freedom means you don t have to ask permission first and that by default you can say what you want If you break our community standards or the law then you re going to face consequences afterwards We won t catch everyone immediately but we can make it harder to try to interfere 5 We are increasing our investment in security and specifically election integrity In the next year we will more than double the team working on election integrity In total we ll add more than 250 people across all our teams focused on security and safety for our community 6 We will expand our partnerships with election commissions around the world We already work with electoral commissions in many countries to help people register to vote and learn about the issues We ll keep doing that and now we re also going to establish a channel to inform election commissions of the online risks we ve identified in their specific elections 7 We will increase sharing of threat information with other tech and security companies We already share information on bad actors on the internet through programs like ThreatExchange and now we re exploring ways we can share more information about anyone attempting to interfere with elections It is important that tech companies collaborate on this because it s almost certain that any actor trying to misuse Facebook will also be trying to abuse other internet platforms too 8 We are working proactively to strengthen the democratic process Beyond pushing back against threats we will also create more services to protect our community while engaging in political discourse For example we re looking at adapting our anti bullying systems to protect against political harassment as well and we re scaling our ballot information tools to help more people understand the issues 9 We have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend from taking actions against thousands of fake accounts to partnering with public authorities like the Federal Office for Information Security to sharing security practices with the candidates and parties We re also examining the activity of accounts we ve removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany This is incredibly important and we have been focused on this for a while At the same time it s important not to lose sight of the more straightforward and larger ways Facebook plays a role in elections and these effects operate at much larger scales of 100x or 1000x bigger than what we re discussing here In 2016 people had billions of interactions and open discussions on Facebook that may never have happened offline Candidates had direct channels to communicate with tens of millions of citizens Campaigns spent tens of millions organizing and advertising online to get their messages out further And we organized get out the vote efforts that helped as many as 2 million people register to vote who might not have voted otherwise Many of these dynamics were new in this election or at much larger scale than ever before in history and at much larger scale than the interference we ve found But we are in a new world It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation states attempting to subvert elections But if that s what we must do we are committed to rising to the occasion Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly We will continue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference and we will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere Thanks for tuning in and we ll keep you updated with more soon You can read more on our Hard Questions blog here http wp me p4eLrC 2fX '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-177', 'content': '  AOL Instant Messenger was a defining part of my childhood As part of the first generation to grow up with the internet it helped me understand internet communication intuitively and emotionally in a way that people just a few years older may have only considered intellectually Growing up I lived in a different town from most of the kids I went to school with I lived in Dobbs Ferry but went to school in Ardsley a town small enough it imported students from nearby towns There was a bridge separating Dobbs Ferry and Ardsley and every day I took a bus across that bridge to school and back home That meant every day after school all of my friends were on the other side of this bridge A lot of my interaction with them was through AIM I developed a lot of empathy for the nuances of how people expressed emotions and ideas online and I became very focused on improving how this worked For example I didn t like that I had no control of whether AIM told my friends I was active online because sometimes I just wanted to code without being interrupted unless someone I really wanted to chat with signed on This may have seemed like a small detail to whoever designed it but it was my social life and I really felt it So I hacked together a tool that let me set myself as if I d been idle for a long time even if I was actually at my computer Because of this Facebook chat today always lets you turn off your online activity indicator My friends and I spent a lot of time curating our online identities We spent hours finding quotes for our AIM profiles that expressed how we felt and we picked just the right font and color for our messages to signal what we wanted about ourselves I built a tool that let me send messages with the letters fading between any colors I wanted It was simple but it was fun to build and it made my messages look different One day my dad saw me using AIM and asked if I could set it up in his office so he could communicate with the other dentists and hygienists I told him I didn t think AIM was ideal and since he controlled the network in his office I could make him something better I built him a system I called ZuckNet that he used for many years afterwards In addition to chatting one on one he could broadcast an update to everyone in the office at the same time It also saved every message you received so you wouldn t lose them when you closed your chat window and it queued up messages to be delivered later if a person wasn t online at the time Everything was encrypted so sensitive information could be secure These were all features that solved pain I felt using AIM ZuckNet improved how the dentists communicated and changed how they worked As a child many people will tell you that you don t have the skills or experience to build something that matters I was certainly told that many times But these days I wonder if children actually have a unique perspective to build some of the most important things The world is changing quickly and only a child has a full emotional understanding of what it s like to grow up today with say mobile phones or AI you ve been able to talk to your whole conscious life If you grew up before this you can intellectually reason about what this might be like but you can only understand all the emotional nuances and develop a world view based on how it feels if you grew up with it yourself I always loved coding I vividly remember riding home on the bus across that bridge after school thinking to myself that now I had the whole evening to build things on my computer Fridays were the best and I remember being even more excited because I had the whole weekend to build things Those early projects and experiences had a lot of the seeds of what would become Facebook Since early on AIM shaped a deep aesthetic sense that the world works better when we can all connect and share I ve lived these ideas since I was a child and I still believe them deeply today Thanks for everything AIM https techcrunch com 2017 10 06 aol instant messenger shut down '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-192', 'content': '  We just announced our quarterly results and community update The most important thing I discussed was the work we re doing to protect the security and integrity of our service We re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability I want to be clear what our priority is protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits Here s what I said  Our community continues to grow now with nearly 2 1 billion people using Facebook every month and nearly 1 4 billion people using it daily Instagram also hit a big milestone this quarter now with 500 million daily actives And we saw good results in the business where total revenue grew 47 year over year and we had our first quarter with more than 10 billion in revenue But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don t bring people closer together or if the foundation of our society is undermined by foreign interference I ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust We build these tools to help people connect and bring us closer together They used them to try to undermine our values What they did is wrong and we re not going to stand for it Now for those who have followed Facebook you know that when we set our minds to something we re going to do it It may be harder than we realize upfront it may take longer and we won t be perfect but we will get it done We re bringing the same intensity to these security issues that we ve brought to any adversary or challenge we ve faced The first step is doing everything we can to help the US government get a complete picture of what happened We ve testified in congress over the past couple of days about the activity we found in last year s election We re working with congress on legislation to make advertising more transparent I think this would be very good if done well And even without legislation we re already moving on our own to bring advertising on Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency than ads on TV or other media That s because in traditional media there s no way to see all of the messages an advertiser is showing to different audiences We re about to start rolling out a tool that lets you see all ads a page is running and also an archive of ads political advertisers have run in the past We re also working with other tech companies to help identify and respond to new threats because as we ve now seen if there s a national security threat involving the internet it will affect many of the major tech companies And we ve announced a number of steps to help keep this kind of interference off our platform This is part of a much bigger focus on protecting the security and integrity of our platform and the safety of our community It goes beyond elections and it means strengthening all of our systems to prevent abuse and harmful content We re doing a lot here with investments in people and technology Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior Some is focused on removing false news hate speech bullying and other problematic content that we don t want in our community We already have about 10 000 people working on safety and security and we re planning to double that to 20 000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads In many places we re doubling or more our engineering efforts focused on security We re also building new AI to detect bad content and bad actors just like we ve done with terrorist propaganda I m dead serious about this and the reason I m talking about this on our earnings call is that I ve directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we re making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward and I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me I believe this will make our society stronger and in doing so will be good for all of us over the long term But I want to be clear about what our priority is protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits So security and the integrity of our service will be a major focus Beyond this our focus is building community I talked about this last quarter when we changed our mission to focus on building community to bring the world closer together and that s more important now than ever And this gets into our roadmap for the next 3 5 and 10 years Over the next three years the biggest trend in our products will be the growth of video This goes both for sharing where we ve seen Stories in Instagram and Status in WhatsApp grow very quickly each with more than 300 million daily actives and also for consuming video content We recently launched the Watch tab where you can discover shows follow creators connect with people watching an episode and join groups with people with similar interests to build community But as video grows it s important to remember that Facebook is about bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interactions it s not primarily about passively consuming content Research shows that interacting with friends and family on social media tends to be more meaningful and can be good for our well being and that s time well spent But when we just passively consume content that may be less true When done well video brings us closer together We ve found that communities formed around video like TV shows or sports create a greater sense of belonging than many other communities We ve found that Live videos generate 10x the number of interactions and comments as other videos But too often right now watching video is just a passive consumption experience Time spent is not a goal by itself We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions So we re going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the video people share and watch That s something Facebook can uniquely do Moving along over the next five years I expect us to make some good progress on several newer initiatives In messaging today already more than 20 million businesses are communicating with customers through Messenger Now we re starting to test business features that make it easier for people to make the same kinds of connections with businesses through WhatsApp We rolled out Marketplace to Canada and 17 countries across Europe giving people the ability to discover buy and sell things in their local communities Today more than 550 million people are using Marketplace and Buy and Sell groups on Facebook to connect with other people for transactions We re also seeing good progress with Workplace helping companies connect their own teams internally through their own versions of Facebook It s been less than a year since we launched Workplace and today more than 30 000 companies are using it This quarter we welcomed on Walmart the largest employer in the US Over the next 10 years we re working on the foundational technologies needed to bring the world closer together I m proud of the work we re doing with AI We re now using machine learning in most of our integrity work to keep our community safe When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico we used AI to look at satellite imagery and identify where people might live and need connectivity and other resources Progress in AI can unlock a lot of opportunities so this quarter we opened a new AI research lab in Montreal and we re building another lab in Paris as well This quarter we held Oculus Connect and we announced Oculus Go our first ever all in one headset that s great for feeling like you re present with someone when you can t physically be together in person It s great for playing games watching movies or hanging out with friends At 199 we think it s going to help us bring great virtual reality experiences to more people It ships next year At Connect I also showed our new Santa Cruz prototype which is the first time any company has shown the full experience of positional tracking in a standalone headset and controllers It s a major technical achievement and I m looking forward to getting this into developers hands next year In order to support our community s growth we need to keep investing in our infrastructure This quarter we broke ground on our new Albany data center and we announced that we ll build our 11th major data center in Henrico County Virginia As always all our new data centers are powered by 100 renewable energy These long term investments are important for our community s future We can do a lot to help connect people through phones and computers but so much more will be possible in a world where everyone has internet access where AI improves all our services and where we can basically teleport anywhere or be within anyone anytime we want With all the issues we face it would be a lot to just invest in addressing those But we know we also have a responsibility to deliver these fundamental technical and scientific advances to fulfill the promise of bringing people closer together so we re going to keep making significant investments looking ahead towards the future too We ve made some real progress this year Across the board we have a lot of work to deliver on our mission of bringing the world closer together but we re committing to rising to the challenge and doing what we need to for our community Thanks to all of you for being part of this journey and I m looking forward to the road ahead '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-200', 'content': '  My personal challenge this year was to have visited every US state by the end of 2017 to listen and learn how people are thinking about their lives their work and their future Last Friday on my last stop of the year I had a conversation with Neeli Bendapudi Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor University of Kansas to discuss what I ve learned Below is a transcript of our conversation edited for clarity and length   Good morning It s an honor to be here with you to conclude this year of travel And I m really excited to hear your questions and to talk about what I ve seen and learned this year  Neeli We are so grateful you chose the University of Kansas as your final stop on this year of travel And I also want to make sure we welcome everyone who s joining us live from all over the world Let s start off I m sure people are wondering how did you end up in Kansas You ve traveled to 30 states this year Most of us do New Year s Resolutions You do a challenge What have you done   Every year I try to take on a personal challenge I think it s really important to push yourself to learn and improve both personally and in work I think it would be easy to spend all my time running Facebook so I try to carve out especially hard yearly challenges One year I decided to try to learn Mandarin That is too hard to do in a year I stuck with it but I only made little progress that first year Last year I tried to run a mile every day That s pretty achievable Before that I tried to read a book every couple of weeks But this year the tone of the campaigns leading up to 2016 and the election I think was just really surprising in terms of how divisive it was no matter which side you were on And it just led me to want to get out of my bubble in San Francisco and try to understand more of what was going on around the country One of the things that struck me was that running Facebook which is such a global company I m more likely to end up traveling to a capital city in another country than to a lot of places in our country I wanted to get out and learn and hear from folks and just be able to see how people were thinking about their work and their lives and thinking about the future and the opportunities and what they were worried about This is especially important for people in the tech industry to do I talked about this upfront when I made the post at the very beginning of the year Globalization and technology have been important trends that have lifted people up and made a lot of progress around the world but I think we re starting to see they ve left a lot of people behind There s a big gap in the country And it s getting bigger I think that s at the heart of a lot of the most divisive political debates that we have And just getting a chance to go out and hear people s perspective on what matters to them My goal was to listen I feel like I learned a lot this year and now I hope to take some of those lessons back with me to the work that I do at Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to make people s lives better  Neeli You ve raised a number of points that I hope we will explore But I have to start with this You ve been all over the country You ve visited so many places What s your number one takeaway   The biggest takeaway by far is that community and especially local community are much more important to people than we realize We all get support from three main areas in our lives You have your friends and family which is the core of your support We have our communities whether they re religious organizations volunteer organizations school organizations that look after us and take care of us And then we have the government safety net for when the first two don t do what we need If you look at the national debate the vast majority of it focuses on what the government should do To some degree some of the debate focuses on what families need to do to pick up and do what the government isn t going to do But not that much of the debate focuses on the role of communities The thing that struck me everywhere I went and I have stories from every state that I visited was how central communities are to people Starting from one of the first visits that I made early in the year to Texas I sat down in Waco with a group of ministers One of the things that struck me right off the bat was they were talking about religion and spirituality but almost as important in how they thought about their role was building community in Waco They told me stories about how when a plant shut down nearby they knew that they were going to see couples for marriage counseling a few weeks later because of the strain and stress that puts on people s lives That s not something our government can do And that s not something that in that particular case the person s family could have done That s a real community support function that these ministers were providing Going to a completely different place I was on the south side of Chicago in the middle of the year I was talking to a handful of students at a school and they were telling me that every single one of them knew a friend who was in a gang I asked them why are your friends in gangs What s going on that you re in school and your friends are in gangs What they said was we all need community And we don t have a YMCA here so we don t have a place to go after school to hang out We don t have a lot of positive role models that we can look up to We have some teachers but for a lot of people they don t have a role model The gangs provide that More than anything economic what they told me was the gangs provide this feeling of family One of the kids said if you can t find love at home you can find it on the streets That was really striking I can give you stories from every state I ve been to about this That need and hunger for community is so deep We don t talk about it enough If there s one theme I feel like I ve learned this year and the common thread through all of our lives is about community We don t agree on everything On big policy debates and a lot of the national issues we may not all agree But one thing I ve found a lot of people do agree on is that what matters most in our lives is what s happening around us our friends our family our work our community And I ve heard this notion from a lot of people that if we could just turn down the temperature a little bit on some of the divisive debates then there actually is more common ground than you might hear a lot of the time in the news based on what we all care about in our communities So that s one of my big takeaways If we can help people focus more of the discussion on building community on local community then I actually think it s possible to build more common ground and make more progress together than you might think from some of the national discussions that are going on  Neeli That s a very interesting point We re social animals We need to belong But how do we build that community right where we live and try to make a difference I have to ask you so what role do you think Facebook plays in building community How could you leverage Facebook for building community for places where these kids in Chicago or other places you ve been that say they are looking for community   Well we re just one company but I do think we can play a role here I think this is so important that earlier this year I actually changed our company s mission for the first time in our history to now focus on building community For the first ten or so years of the company we mostly focused on helping people connect with friends and family And we re always going to do that But now on top of that we also want to help people build community One of the things we first need to internalize is that as a society we re starting in a little bit of a hole here Because if you start digging into the sociology research it s actually the case that for the last few decades membership in all kinds of communities religious volunteer all kinds of organizations has declined as much as 25 That s millions and millions of people who need that kind of support from communities who now are not getting it That means that this is more important than ever and even more of a reason why we need to shine more of a spotlight on this What we try to do with Facebook is look at how people use our groups and communities It turns out that there are more than a hundred million people who are using groups and define the groups they re in as meaningful communities There are a lot more people who are in groups that are fine but not necessarily meaningful communities I m in this group for people who like the same kind of dog that I like I get cute photos but I m not building meaningful community connections through that Someone is but that s not for me But for me it was when my dad went in for heart surgery we formed a community around that That was meaningful We define meaningful communities as upon joining this group it becomes one of the most meaningful parts of your social support network in your life Think about if you get diagnosed with a rare disease Now you have a group to connect with other people who have that disease around the world to share that experience There might not be anyone in your town but around the world someone else is going to have that experience And you can share that experience and connect over that That s a really meaningful community for people I recently became a parent a couple years ago New parenthood is a new experience  Neeli That s a big community   That s a big change in your life Joining a community for new parents where you can share the different things you re experiencing and get advice that s meaningful When you re a new parent joining that kind of community can become one of the most important things in your life And in terms of traveling around this year I ve seen a lot of different examples of this I went to North Carolina and visited Fort Bragg which is the biggest military base in the world I had a chance to sit down with a group of military spouses who told me that when their partners get relocated from one base to another it uproots their life Now they have to find a new school for their kids they have to find a new home a new job new friends in the area So one of the first things that they do is go look up the Facebook group and community for military spouses near that base Now one of the questions I started asking myself after that visit was if we have 2 billion people who use Facebook then why are only 100 million of them in meaningful groups Why aren t we doing a better job of connecting more people to meaningful groups That is the whole thrust of what I want our company to focus on now We have this whole road map that we ve worked on to help people connect to meaningful groups that are out there and to give people the tools that they need to organize these groups I think that if we can do that we can start to turn around this trend for the past few decades of people joining fewer groups in society And we can start to strengthen and rebuild our social fabric This is a bigger issue than any one company can solve But I do think it s really important We all need to do our part to work on this  Neeli I see that too This is the whole bowling alone phenomenon of how people don t have those groups anymore So let s talk about one of the things you ve been asked a lot about recently and that was Facebook and the role in elections I am really eager to find out what are you doing to prevent Russian or frankly any outside interference in our free democratic process in the United States   This is really important This is an area where we just have an enormous responsibility A lot of people come to Facebook every day to connect with friends and family and while they re there people want to share what s important to them and discuss the most important things that are going on It is absolutely our responsibility to protect the security and integrity of that platform I think it s very clear at this point that the Russians tried to use these tools to sow distrust leading up to the 2016 election and afterwards What they did is wrong And it is our responsibility to do everything we can to prevent them or anyone else from doing this again There are a number of things that we re doing The first thing I view as our responsibility is to help our government understand exactly what happened Facebook is one piece of a much broader puzzle on how the Russians tried to attack the democratic process So what we ve tried to do including in the testimony in Congress a couple of weeks ago I directed our team to be as transparent as possible to help the government understand our piece of this what happened on Facebook That way they can put together all the pieces what happened across other companies other hacking that may have happened information that the intelligence community has that we wouldn t have access to They need to understand the whole picture so they can understand as our government what the right way to respond and move forward is But in addition to that we invest a huge amount in security We already did before this And now we re going to do even more now that we understand that there are new kinds of threats that we need to face Already by the end of this year we ll have about 10 000 people at Facebook who work on safety and security I talked about this on our earnings call a couple weeks ago that we re going to more than double that in the next year to now have more than 20 000 people working on safety and security both having people review things and building technology so we can more automatically find different things that are going on across the network The reason why I talked about this on our earnings call a couple weeks ago is that we re investing so much in security that it s actually going to significantly impact the profitability of the company I just wanted to be really clear about this upfront because I think it s important that anyone who s going to be involved in our company whether you re an investor partner or employee you need to know our priorities I just want to be absolutely clear that our priority is protecting our community is important to us than maximizing our profits That s just a really important part of how we ve always tried to run the company And I think that that is our responsibility here But this is a new kind of threat Nation states trying to attack online communities to try to subvert elections But I am confident that with enough work on this and collaboration with other companies and with the government that we can make progress and make this much much harder for anyone to do in the future  Neeli I really appreciate your answer I think this is on everybody s minds and I m glad we were able to talk about it What you say also applies to things like globalization and technology Earlier you alluded to it Across the country a big topic of conversation is what happens what s the impact of they re so intertwined not just the political issues but the globalization and technology the impact on jobs what does it do to local economies What have you found in this one year of reflection and travel   In most places I ve gone globalization technology and trade have been big themes that have come up And one of the things that really struck me is that when there s a disruption if you lose a job that doesn t just impact you and your family in the short term But it actually shapes how you think about what you want to do over the long term too Let me give you a couple of examples Earlier this year I was in Millinocket Maine in a town that was completely built around a paper mill So there was basically no town there before Then this paper mill company came It built housing so it could have workers It built a school there People in the community knew if they grew up they could get a job at the paper mill if they wanted to It was very intertwined with the town Then the mills closed for a number of reasons including globalization and technology Globalization because a lot of the lumber milling work moved a few hundred miles away to Canada And technology because now instead of just using wood more people want to use synthetic wood products that are stronger and cheaper to build homes and other buildings So for a number of reasons there s this disruption to the paper mill industry I was talking to a number of the people there They re very enterprising and of course if you lose a job you re going to work on getting retrained and go do another job But one of the things that really struck me was a number of these folks were really afraid that the new job that they were getting trained for was also just going to get replaced by trade or globalization or technology And I was listening to this and thinking hey you know you just got retrained in something that s a very important modern job It doesn t seem to me like that s really at risk of being replaced for the foreseeable future But that fear was really shaping how people were thinking about it One guy even said I wasn t sure I wanted to get another job I was so worried that my job might just get replaced And that s a problem We need him to work We need that productivity in our economy If that disruption is making it so that people feel lack of confidence and feel like it s not worth bothering because of these trends in the past that s a really big deal The flip side of this that s also interesting is there was a guy in that discussion who had been in trucking for 30 years Now one of the big discussions in Silicon Valley is self driving cars and trucks and how this is going to affect jobs In Silicon Valley a lot of the discussion is quite pessimistic in terms of people are worried about the future of these jobs But here was this trucker and he was not at all worried He was very optimistic about the future He said we don t even have good internet in our town how are we going to have self driving trucks Across the country I ve talked to a handful of truckers with similar views In Iowa I went to this truck stop and I sat down and asked a number of the folks there I m asked how are you thinking about what s going to happen with self driving cars and trucks And it was basically the same attitude ranging from skepticism that the technology would ever work enough to make a difference to optimism that if it did it would actually be helpful to them rather than disruptive You have people who are doing long haul trucking who said it would be great if I could take a nap while my truck was driving itself and I could just drive the last mile That would increase productivity So if you consider globalization trade and technology looking backwards the people who have been affected by it it really does leave this emotional disruption as well as this economic disruption to what they think their prospects are going forward Whereas if you think about potential issues in the future people are much more optimistic That s a case that people probably should be more optimistic about the way the future can go The last thing I ll say on this is that one thing that I think everyone can agree on regardless of what you think is going to happen with globalization and trade is that training for modern jobs is really important That s one of the big takeaways from these trips That s why yesterday when I was in St Louis we announced the Facebook Community Boost program What we ve found is if you want to build strong communities strong local businesses are an important part of communities I think we can all name a small business that not only is creating jobs in our community but is a place that people come together and hang out and connect That s really the center of the community The more that we can do to help entrepreneurs use digital tools to build new businesses or take existing businesses and grow them or if you re not trying to create a business if you re trying to find a job get the digital skills those businesses want in employees in order to grow then I think that that would be a really positive step That s something we as a company understanding some of the technology trends have a responsibility to do I m really happy that we re doing this Community Boost program We re going to do it in 30 cities across the country The first version already helped train more than 60 000 small businesses Now we hope to do more going forward So that you want to train people for modern jobs that seems to be something that everyone can agree on I m glad we re doing more there  Neeli You raised some very good points Because it s not just an economic issue It s a way of life Threatening the community We need to shore up the individuals and the community to be able to prepare for these changes You were talking about some people who were able to say how will we differentiate ourselves and turn it into a positive and say maybe I can t play the price game but I might compete on quality   One of the most inspiring things from this year is anywhere you go there are a lot of challenges but there are always people making it happen And I think that s just really inspiring One of the stories that struck me this year I was in New Orleans and I went down to the Ninth Ward the neighborhood that was struck the hardest by Hurricane Katrina After the hurricane a lot of people left the neighborhood because it completely flooded a lot of homes Because there weren t a lot of people no one would invest to build a grocery store so the people in the neighborhood had nowhere to get fresh food There was a guy who I met Burnell Cotlon who I think it s worth calling out is a veteran It s Veteran s Day so thank you to Burnell for your service and to all of you veterans So Burnell decided that he was going to take it upon himself to build a grocery store But the thing is he didn t know anything about building a grocery store But as a veteran he said I ve done much harder things I can do this So he went on the internet and started watching videos on how to run electrical wiring and how to install roofing and he did it He built a grocery store by hand It took him a little while but he did it That way people in his community could have a place to get fresh food Then he decided now I m going to build a barber shop so people have a place to come together and then I m going to build a laundromat and a playground and an internet cafe He s single handedly not just building an important small business in the community but is rebuilding the real cornerstone of the community It s really hard to meet someone like Burnell and not be really inspired But the thing that s even more inspiring is there are people like that all over in every place you go The story we were talking about around trade was I was talking to a handful of fishermen in the South And they were talking to me about how there are real challenges around globalization and trade They were talking about how there are countries like India and Vietnam that subsidize exports The cost of labor in a lot of these places is cheaper already On top of that if you have the Indian government subsidizing the fish exports it s probably pretty hard for Americans to compete on price I was with a group of ten folks and they were talking about how this was a really big challenge for their businesses And then of course there s the one business that s figured it out and says we re going to take this challenge and turn it into a big opportunity What they figured out was that since now there s more international trade what they were going to do is not just sell their seafood locally but sell it internationally too and sell it as a premium American product So not trying to compete on price but flipping the whole thing on its head To me that s the American spirit That s the entrepreneurial spirit You go around to all these places and yes we have challenges whether they re due to policies around globalization or trade or whether they re natural disasters like Katrina But there are always people who are working through it and coming up with innovative solutions Just yesterday I was in Centralia Missouri on my last stop before I came here And I was talking to these two brothers young guys 25 and 21 years old They run one of the largest free range egg farms in the country You talk to them it s like you guys are the future You re 25 and 21 years old You ve been doing this since middle and high school And yes they have to deal with different regulations that come up At one point they had to downsize from 25 000 to 7 000 chickens because of regulations they needed to manage But you just get the sense talking to these folks they re going to make it happen They re going to figure this out And it s just inspiring to see  Neeli I love all the examples you re giving because I do believe small business without question so far outpaces big business in terms of number of jobs created people hired etc But it s also the nobility of business When they do that they are building community as well   Yes 60 of people who work work in small businesses  Neeli Even though I want all my entrepreneurs listening to feel free to build businesses like yours We re not against big business   We started small too  Neeli This has been fascinating Thank you for your answers I ve been curious 30 stops And you know you have to end up in Kansas to cap it off Is there something that has truly surprised you that you didn t expect to see What would you say And maybe even something that maybe disappointed you to see   The biggest surprise by far has been the extent of the opioid issues And it is really saddening to see I think people are pretty widely familiar with some of the stats at this point In 2016 64 000 people died of drug overdoses That s more people than died from AIDS at the peak of the epidemic That s more Americans than died in the whole Vietnam War It s more people than die of car accidents and gun violence combined And it s still growing quickly From 2015 to 2016 I think the number of drug overdose deaths went up almost 20 You sit down with some of these folks and you just get a sense of how intense the forces at play are and the impacts on the community I sat down with a group of recovering heroin addicts in Dayton Ohio And I just asked them to explain it to me One woman told me when you re a heroin addict you re not trying to overdose and die She said I was trying to shoot up enough to get as close as I could without dying I listened to that and just thought oh my god One man told me sorry this stuff is just really upsetting to talk about One man told me that he was with his friend who was shooting up and starting to overdose And all he could think about was I wonder who that guy s dealer is because that must be really good stuff That s just intense And then you get the sense of how it impacts not just on a health basis but everyone in the community I talked to police officers in Dayton They said one day they had 29 overdose calls that they had to go respond to And one of the thoughts that was going through her mind was it s important to respond to these this is critical but this is also straining our resources and I wonder what other things we re not getting to because we have this issue as well to deal with Going across the country this year one of the things that struck me is that I don t think we fully internalize how this epidemic has affected people s attitudes more broadly on policy issues Even if it were only a public health crisis it would be one of the worst public health crises we ve ever faced But there s enough data that suggests that one of the biggest correlations with people who voted Democrat and then voted Republican were the counties that had the highest percent of overdose deaths One story that blew me away was when I was in Alabama I was talking to this guy on his shrimping boat and I asked him what issues are you worried about for the country He said terrorism I said all right you re in somewhat rural Alabama Are you worried for your safety here that someone is going to blow up a bomb He said no that s not it He said the issue is that there are all these drugs in our community And I can t hire people because I don t want people on my shrimping boat who are going to be on drugs I m fearful for my daughter with all the crime that s going on in our town And I know that a lot of these drugs are coming in from other countries I just think that the harm coming from other places is a big issue for the country So that s a bunch of issues tied up together that I think a lot of people don t think about I think it s easy for a lot of folks who just think about any given policy issue to segment these issues and say okay here s a public health crisis here s a set of immigration issues here s a set of public safety issues here are jobs issues and how do you find people who can do the work we need But what you find across the country is that for a lot of people the attitudes towards these issues are very connected I actually think that the opioid issues being so pervasive have likely had much more of an effect on people s attitudes towards public issues than we fully realize Now I do think that the opioid crisis is starting to get more attention From my perspective and what I saw this year it s still getting nowhere near the attention that it needs But the good news if you can call it that is that you can look at other countries that have had serious heroin and opioid issues like France for example in the early 2000s and there is a roadmap for how you deal with this It s not going to happen overnight and I think the issue will likely get worse before it gets better but if we do the right things as a country and more often actually at the state level there is a roadmap for how we can improve this situation  Neeli There s no question We need to figure it out And as you say it s a multi pronged issue It s very very complex And a simple one size fits all won t work And that s interesting too It probably comes back to each community and what you do One of the things I was reading about and I wonder if you have reflections on it too is how where you are the geography of where you are located how it might impact you in terms of community Someone trying to get over a drug habit   Opportunity is not equally distributed  Neeli I do believe that   The big question is why And one of the things that I found striking this year is that it s often the relationships you have that make a bigger difference than what you know That may seem like a trite thing to say so let me give you a few examples that I think drive this home We were just talking about opioids a second ago Most people who are addicted to opioids they don t necessarily want to be addicted to opioids They know it s bad And they know the things they re technically supposed to do to get off it So if you go to treatment the first thing you ll do is detox But after that the next thing that you need to do the next most important step is to sever all ties with anyone you know who is still using drugs If your best friend is still shooting up then you have a very high chance of ending up back on drugs and risking your life Now this gets really tough because what if it s not just a friend but it s your spouse That actually is a life or death decision that you have to make that relationship and that influence ends up being more important than all of the information you can be told You can know all the facts in your mind but if in your heart and the relationships you have if you re around people who are doing these things your chance of ending up back using heroin and risking your life is really high Another example that was heartbreaking I was in South Bend Indiana and I went to a juvenile detention center Some of the kids who are in the juvenile detention center are there for things that are serious crimes They stole something big or they hurt someone But a lot of the kids who were there are there simply because they misbehaved in school There have been studies on the impact of being there What is clear is that if you go to a juvenile detention center you are more likely to end up in prison later in life than if you don t I m talking about the cases that are more like you misbehaved in school The kids who misbehaved and didn t go to juvenile detention versus the kids who misbehaved and were sent their outcomes are much worse Why is that A good theory is that we re basically building the wrong social network for those kids Instead of having positive role models around them we re connecting them with people who doing things that are really bad And that decreases their prospects and opportunity going forward Some of this is also about the values in communities You were asking about different geographies I don t know how familiar you are with Raj Chetty s work on opportunity and mobility One of the things he found is that in different counties people are more or less likely to leave home and seek opportunity elsewhere than in other places And so where you live ends up being a big determinant of opportunity I saw some of this play out I was in Iowa in a small town called Wilton and I went to this place called the Candy Kitchen I got a milkshake I was talking to the girl who was making the milkshake and I asked what do you want to be when you grow up She said I want to move to Atlanta and be a dental hygienist I thought good for you Sure enough if you look at the data Iowa scores really high in terms of having communities that value encouraging people to go seek opportunity in different places And that does end up I think being a part of opportunity It s not just values it s also do you have the economic opportunity though But a key point is that if there aren t as many jobs in rural areas as there used to be one of the big questions is do you have the freedom and desire to go seek opportunity in different places And that definitely does seem to be different in different places around the country  Neeli I am so glad that you re paying attention to this especially as Facebook and in your philanthropic efforts because the key to what you ve said comes back to community If there are two kids and they re both doing the same thing and one ends up in juvie and one does not a lot has to do with the social capital and who can advocate for them and what we can do   There s a lot to do On Facebook there are things we can do We ve built systems over the past ten years at Facebook to help you connect with people you may know already A lot of you are probably familiar with that So one of the questions I asked our team is can we help people connect with people you should know A mentor a teacher There s a lot of data that suggests that if you have just one teacher or parent or mentor who can raise your sights that makes a big impact If there s an opportunity for us to build that that s a big deal In our philanthropic work one of the big areas we re working on is criminal justice reform To the extent that having kids go to juvenile detention ends up being negative for their lives you want that not to happen It s not necessary  Neeli I agree For the students we talk about it s who you know versus what you know There s a big distinction The truth is who you know determines what you know If you don t have certain connections you never have access to information All right We ve got to get back to you We ve talked about all of your travels all over Have you learned anything about yourself What have you learned about yourself  Inquiring minds want to know   I think I started this year as an engineer and now I m wrapping it up thinking of myself as more of a community builder too  Neeli I want everybody to be a community builder Go on tell me more What do you mean by that   The engineering mindset and values are really about problem solving There are a lot of problems so we need to focus on that A lot of community building is about sharing values and being transparent about them supporting people and not just solving problems and protecting people from external threats From what I ve seen in my work at Facebook and a lot of communities I ve visited and also now as a parent I think that element is just a lot more important Around the country as we ve talked about building community is just a really foundational element that a lot of people need for support A lot of this support is not necessarily going to come from the government I think people want that locally And that s an area I think we can all help work on As a parent I think you learn that there aren t that many problems that a 2 year old has that require an engineering mindset to solve  Neeli Negotiation skills are important at that age   I don t know that that s an engineering thing but that s true But being a parent is very much about imparting values Over the past couple of years I ve focused on that more and more But also if you just think about where Facebook is now in my work there We have big problems that we need to work through But I also think that we re at the scale at this point that it s not just about solving the problems That alone isn t enough I think we also need to be very clear about what our values are that go into the different decisions we re making A lot of these problems are problems that no one company can solve We need to work together We need alignment on values We need to be transparent We need to recognize that for the scale that we re at transparency builds trust Our responsibility is growing and that also means a responsibility to share more about how we think about solving problems And that also means being more accountable as well I ll always be an engineer But I think this year I really got more of an appreciation for how strongly I care about some of these parts of what I need to do around building community sharing values and supporting people  Neeli So last question Overall given everything you ve seen the good and the bad how do you feel about where we are as a country And would you say overall optimistic pessimistic where are you looking ahead   If I seem optimistic it s because I am  Neeli That s the answer I was hoping for   One of my favorite sayings is that there are two kinds of people optimists and pessimists And the saying goes optimists tend to be successful and pessimists tend to be right The idea is that if you think something s going to be terrible then you re going to look for data points that prove you right And you re going to find them That s what pessimists do But if you believe something is possible then you re going to look for a way to make it work and even when you make mistakes even when people doubt you you re just going to keep pushing forward until you find a way to make it happen The world is full of pessimists right now And there s no doubt we face a lot of challenges and we have a lot of responsibility and a lot of work ahead But I think we also have a responsibility to remain optimistic that we can solve these problems Because optimists are the only ones who will Warren Buffett has this saying that I ll adapt slightly for this be fearful when others are optimistic and be optimistic when others are fearful We all have a deep responsibility to bring people closer together To believe that we can To believe that the big questions are not yet answered but that through our work we can help people build a better tomorrow I believe that we can I believe in us I believe in you the next generation because we re the optimists And we have a lot of work to do right now Neeli I love it Because as you said through your experiences the Burnells of the world and these young Jayhawks sitting here and the young people listening to you everywhere across the world I have hope that they will be optimistic and they will break through those barriers and build community and find a way to solve things I m so grateful that you chose to make the University of Kansas your last stop in your Year of Travel You make me optimistic about the future Thank you Mark Thank you all for coming out What a great way to end the year of travel Thank you so much '}\n",

      "{'filename': '2017-206', 'content': '  Lessons in Philanthropy 2017Two years ago when our daughter Max was born Priscilla and I wrote a letter about the world we hoped she and all children would grow up in In that letter we shared our plans to give 99 of our Facebook shares to help make that world a reality A lot has changed since then Max is now running around the house telling jokes or at least trying Knock knock Who s there Max Orange Orange who Glad to seeee you Max I m not sure that s how the joke goes We now have a second daughter August and Beast is hanging in there We ve also started to take the words in that letter and make them real And we ve learned a lot getting the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative off the ground Going in we knew we wanted to help take on some of the biggest challenges the next generation will face improving education advancing science and fighting for justice and opportunity But there was a huge amount we didn t know and are still figuring out Our goal for this letter is to share some of what we ve learned and talk about our next steps to help create a better world for our children As always we re grateful to be on this journey with you The most important lesson we ve learned is to focus on problems we have some unique ability to help solve Different philanthropies are good at different things For example our friends Bill and Melinda Gates have built an incredible foundation that is data driven and has strong international relationships to support their work in public health In this year s letter we ll discuss two aspects of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative that have shaped our work so far a truly long term approach and a technology mindset A long term approach means helping the most talented leaders take on challenges in education science justice and economic opportunity over 10 or 20 years rather than just focusing on the biggest issues of today One example is the current debate in the US about healthcare Right now there are two options provide health insurance coverage to more people at higher cost or provide less coverage at lower cost But over a 20 year period by helping scientists prevent and cure more diseases our hope is to create a third option provide everyone with great healthcare for less cost Another example is education A lot of today s debates pit district schools against charter schools or reformers against unions But over the long term we need to build tools to empower every teacher at every school to provide personalized instruction and mentorship to every student Instead of engaging in zero sum debates we think we ll help more by building tools to help all teachers everywhere Our second theme is about technology The magic of technology is that it can help social change scale faster And because of Mark s experience building a world class engineering organization at Facebook we are in a unique position to build a philanthropy with a great engineering team to help our partners scale their social change faster as well One challenge we ve seen in education is that there are many brilliant teachers and school leaders who create new kinds of schools based on new models of learning but those schools usually only serve hundreds of students while most children still do not have access to them There are very few examples of new school models that expand to thousands of schools today Our hope is that technology can help with this scaling challenge We re seeing promising signs of early success where our partnership with Summit Public Schools has helped encode their teaching philosophy in tools that will be used in more than 300 district charter and private schools this fall Building a philanthropy that can build technology is useful because a lot of our partners don t have this capability When we first started working with Summit I remember asking their founder Dianne Tavenner if I could meet her engineering team She said Sure I ll introduce you to him When I asked her why she only had one engineer on her team she responded that as a teacher she was lucky to have even one engineer Similarly when we talk to scientists they often tell us how much more they could do if they had 5 to 10 long term engineers working in their labs Many of them have developed promising prototypes but don t have the resources to build them out and share them with more labs to move the whole field forward By building a world class engineering team we can help all our partners accelerate their progress You can start to see how these two aspects of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative a long term approach and a technology mindset shape all our work Next let s discuss how these values influence our work in the three areas we re focused on improving education advancing science and fighting for justice and opportunity Let s start with improving education It s hard to overstate how important education is for our children s future If you take a long term view most economic issues today can be solved for our children and the next generation by dramatically improving our education system To imagine what a future education system might look like consider the research of Benjamin Bloom showing that if you take an average student and give them one to one tutoring they will perform two standard deviations better than other students learning by conventional techniques In other words if a student is at the 50th percentile in their class and they receive effective one on one tutoring they jump on average to the 98th percentile That suggests we need an education system where all students receive the equivalent of an expert one on one tutor That is what we mean when we refer to personalized learning Rather than having every student sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher explain the same material at the same pace in the same way regardless of a student s strengths learning style and interests research shows students will perform better if they can learn at their own pace based on their own interests and in a style that fits them For example some students are stronger at math and weaker at history Others learn better by reading than doing practice problems So they should have an experience where teachers can easily show them material that helps them advance at their own pace and in the way they ll learn best But delivering this experience is only the first step Scaling this approach to every classroom is an important challenge as well There are multiple dimensions to this problem but we believe any scalable approach will involve giving teachers and students better tools An example is the personalized learning tool for teachers I mentioned above that we ve built with Summit Public Schools We re going to build tools that include other schools approaches too There are 25 000 middle and high schools in the US and our goal is help many of them use these tools over the next decade Sometimes the personalized tools students need are as simple as eyeglasses It s hard to learn if you can t see That s why we re supporting Vision To Learn in their effort to get exams and glasses to every student who needs them Next we re working to accelerate science and help scientists cure prevent and manage all diseases in our children s lifetime This may seem like an overly ambitious goal but it s a good example how we can have a great impact over the long term by developing new tools and technology There s good reason to be optimistic Ever since we started treating medicine as a science with controlled experiments about 80 years ago our average life expectancy has steadily increased by 1 4 of a year ever year from about 50 to over 75 This is the result of continuous progress on diseases ranging from smallpox to cancer to AIDS If we want to continue this trend history of science suggests most breakthroughs occur when scientists get access to new tools that help them see and experiment in new ways The telescope the microscope DNA sequencing each unlocked more progress than their inventors imagined Our strategy is to develop tools and technology to keep accelerating the pace of science One example is the Human Cell Atlas Think of it like the periodic table of elements in chemistry but for biology There are more than 10 000 different types of cells in the human body but no one has identified or examined the properties of all of them Once the atlas is complete it will be an important resource for helping scientists understand basic biology and how to get cells to interact to ultimately cure diseases We re working on the Human Cell Atlas with teams around the world including the European Bioinformatics Institute the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and UC Santa Cruz The idea is that by making this knowledge available to everyone in the scientific community we ll all make progress faster That s also why we established the Biohub a collaboration between scientists and engineers across Stanford UCSF and Berkeley to develop tools to fight disease We re also working on a knowledge sharing and search engine for scientists called Meta and we hope to work on more new tools next year Finally we re fighting for justice and opportunity so all this progress builds a better future for everyone A big part of this is advocating for policy change another area where a long term approach and technology mindset can make a difference Change takes time The campaign for marriage equality for example took more than 15 years But today most political campaigns are focused on the next election in a couple months or years rather than long term change If we can help support long term campaigns in areas like criminal justice reform immigration reform and housing we have a chance to make an even bigger difference Advocacy also requires building better tools and technology Since most campaigns are only run for short periods they don t have time to do significant tools development Even the longest political campaigns are usually only a couple of years and do not do much tool development themselves We think there s an opportunity to create social change by focusing on building tools for issue advocacy One issue we re focused on is criminal justice reform The US has 5 of the world s population but almost 25 of its prisoners We put more people behind bars than any other country and we do it despite evidence that a higher incarceration rate doesn t make us safer Criminal justice is a local issue and many relevant policies are at the state and city levels That means there are issues on the ballot in different places every year which allows our partners and us to continuously iterate and evolve our approach Data is important because the first step to improving our criminal justice system is understanding it Today different counties maintain different records making it hard to understand the full problem That s why we re supporting organizations like Measures for Justice to make the system more transparent by tracking and sharing data county by county giving attorneys policy makers and regular citizens the tools to search and analyze it We re taking a similar approach to our work with local partners on immigration reform housing and systemic poverty and inequality These are all challenges that can benefit from a longer time horizon and technology mindset Beyond these lessons we ve also learned about ourselves A lot of people ask us what it s like to work with your spouse The reality is we have very different experiences as a doctor and educator and an engineer and executive so we learn a lot from each other We ve had to make some rules though like not talking about work right before bed What makes us a good team is that we re both optimistic about the future at a time when a lot of people don t feel that way We believe there are answers to even the toughest problems and one of the things we re most proud of is that we ve built a team that believes that too Improving education advancing science and fighting for justice and opportunity are some of the most important challenges to solve for our children s generation That s why we decided to jump in and start now Thanks for being on this journey with us and we re looking forward to continuing to share what we learn along the way '}\n",
      "{'filename': '2017-208', 'content': '  Building Global CommunityTo our community On our journey to connect the world we often discuss products we re building and updates on our business Today I want to focus on the most important question of all are we building the world we all want History is the story of how we ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers from tribes to cities to nations At each step we built social infrastructure like communities media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn t on our own Today we are close to taking our next step Our greatest opportunities are now global like spreading prosperity and freedom promoting peace and understanding lifting people out of poverty and accelerating science Our greatest challenges also need global responses like ending terrorism fighting climate change and preventing pandemics Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations but also as a global community This is especially important right now Facebook stands for bringing us closer together and building a global community When we began this idea was not controversial Every year the world got more connected and this was seen as a positive trend Yet now across the world there are people left behind by globalization and movements for withdrawing from global connection There are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone and whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology We always overestimate what we can do in two years and we underestimate what we can do in ten years We may not have the power to create the world we want immediately but we can all start working on the long term today In times like these the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us For the past decade Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families With that foundation our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community for supporting us for keeping us safe for informing us for civic engagement and for inclusion of all Bringing us all together as a global community is a project bigger than any one organization or company but Facebook can help contribute to answering these five important questions How do we help people build supportive communities that strengthen traditional institutions in a world where membership in these institutions is declining How do we help people build a safe community that prevents harm helps during crises and rebuilds afterwards in a world where anyone across the world can affect us How do we help people build an informed community that exposes us to new ideas and builds common understanding in a world where every person has a voice How do we help people build a civically engaged community in a world where participation in voting sometimes includes less than half our population How do we help people build an inclusive community that reflects our collective values and common humanity from local to global levels spanning cultures nations and regions in a world with few examples of global communities My hope is that more of us will commit our energy to building the long term social infrastructure to bring humanity together The answers to these questions won t all come from Facebook but I believe we can play a role Our job at Facebook is to help people make the greatest positive impact while mitigating areas where technology and social media can contribute to divisiveness and isolation Facebook is a work in progress and we are dedicated to learning and improving We take our responsibility seriously and today I want to talk about how we plan to do our part to build this global community Supportive CommunitiesBuilding a global community that works for everyone starts with the millions of smaller communities and intimate social structures we turn to for our personal emotional and spiritual needs Whether they re churches sports teams unions or other local groups they all share important roles as social infrastructure for our communities They provide all of us with a sense of purpose and hope moral validation that we are needed and part of something bigger than ourselves comfort that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us mentorship guidance and personal development a safety net values cultural norms and accountability social gatherings rituals and a way to meet new people and a way to pass time In our society we have personal relationships with friends and family and then we have institutional relationships with the governments that set the rules A healthy society also has many layers of communities between us and government that take care of our needs When we refer to our social fabric we usually mean the many mediating groups that bring us together and reinforce our values However there has been a striking decline in the important social infrastructure of local communities over the past few decades Since the 1970s membership in some local groups has declined by as much as one quarter cutting across all segments of the population The decline raises deeper questions alongside surveys showing large percentages of our population lack a sense of hope for the future It is possible many of our challenges are at least as much social as they are economic related to a lack of community and connection to something greater than ourselves As one pastor told me People feel unsettled A lot of what was settling in the past doesn t exist anymore Online communities are a bright spot and we can strengthen existing physical communities by helping people come together online as well as offline In the same way connecting with friends online strengthens real relationships developing this infrastructure will strengthen these communities as well as enable completely new ones to form A woman named Christina was diagnosed with a rare disorder called Epidermolysis Bullosa and now she s a member of a group that connects 2 400 people around the world so none of them have to suffer alone A man named Matt was raising his two sons by himself and he started the Black Fathers group to help men share advice and encouragement as they raise their families In San Diego more than 4 000 military family members are part of a group that helps them make friends with other spouses These communities don t just interact online They hold get togethers organize dinners and support each other in their daily lives We recently found that more than 100 million people on Facebook are members of what we call very meaningful groups These are groups that upon joining quickly become the most important part of our social network experience and an important part of our physical support structure For example many new parents tell us that joining a parenting group after having a child fits this purpose There is a real opportunity to connect more of us with groups that will be meaningful social infrastructure in our lives More than one billion people are active members of Facebook groups but most don t seek out groups on their own friends send invites or Facebook suggests them If we can improve our suggestions and help connect one billion people with meaningful communities that can strengthen our social fabric Going forward we will measure Facebook s progress with groups based on meaningful groups not groups overall This will require not only helping people connect with existing meaningful groups but also enabling community leaders to create more meaningful groups for people to connect with The most successful physical communities have engaged leaders and we ve seen the same with online groups as well In Berlin a man named Monis Bukhari runs a group where he personally helps refugees find homes and jobs Today Facebook s tools for group admins are relatively simple We plan to build more tools to empower community leaders like Monis to run and grow their groups the way they d like similar to what we ve done with Pages Most communities are made of many sub communities and this is another clear area for developing new tools A school for example is not a single community but many smaller groups among its classes dorms and student groups Just as the social fabric of society is made up of many communities each community is made of many groups of personal connections We plan to expand groups to support sub communities We can look at many activities through the lens of building community Watching video of our favorite sports team or TV show reading our favorite newspaper or playing our favorite game are not just entertainment or information but a shared experience and opportunity to bring together people who care about the same things We can design these experiences not for passive consumption but for strengthening social connections Our goal is to strengthen existing communities by helping us come together online as well as offline as well as enabling us to form completely new communities transcending physical location When we do this beyond connecting online we reinforce our physical communities by bringing us together in person to support each other A healthy society needs these communities to support our personal emotional and spiritual needs In a world where this physical social infrastructure has been declining we have a real opportunity to help strengthen these communities and the social fabric of our society Safe CommunityAs we build a global community this is a moment of truth Our success isn t just based on whether we can capture videos and share them with friends It s about whether we re building a community that helps keep us safe that prevents harm helps during crises and rebuilds afterwards Today s threats are increasingly global but the infrastructure to protect us is not Problems like terrorism natural disasters disease refugee crises and climate change need coordinated responses from a worldwide vantage point No nation can solve them alone A virus in one nation can quickly spread to others A conflict in one country can create a refugee crisis across continents Pollution in one place can affect the environment around the world Humanity s current systems are insufficient to address these issues Many dedicated people join global non profit organizations to help but the market often fails to fund or incentivize building the necessary infrastructure I have long expected more organizations and startups to build health and safety tools using technology and I have been surprised by how little of what must be built has even been attempted There is a real opportunity to build global safety infrastructure and I have directed Facebook to invest more and more resources into serving this need For some of these problems the Facebook community is in a unique position to help prevent harm assist during a crisis or come together to rebuild afterwards This is because of the amount of communication across our network our ability to quickly reach people worldwide in an emergency and the vast scale of people s intrinsic goodness aggregated across our community To prevent harm we can build social infrastructure to help our community identify problems before they happen When someone is thinking of suicide or hurting themselves we ve built infrastructure to give their friends and community tools that could save their life When a child goes missing we ve built infrastructure to show Amber Alerts and multiple children have been rescued without harm And we ve built infrastructure to work with public safety organizations around the world when we become aware of these issues Going forward there are even more cases where our community should be able to identify risks related to mental health disease or crime To help during a crisis we ve built infrastructure like Safety Check so we can all let our friends know we re safe and check on friends who might be affected by an attack or natural disaster Safety Check has been activated almost 500 times in two years and has already notified people that their families and friends are safe more than a billion times When there is a disaster governments often call us to make sure Safety Check has been activated in their countries But there is more to build We recently added tools to find and offer shelter food and other resources during emergencies Over time our community should be able to help during wars and ongoing issues that are not limited to a single event To rebuild after a crisis we ve built the world s largest social infrastructure for collective action A few years ago after an earthquake in Nepal the Facebook community raised 15 million to help people recover and rebuild which was the largest crowdfunded relief effort in history We saw a similar effort after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando when people across the country organized blood donations to help victims they had never met Similarly we built tools so millions of people could commit to becoming organ donors to save others after accidents and registries reported larger boosts in sign ups than ever before Looking ahead one of our greatest opportunities to keep people safe is building artificial intelligence to understand more quickly and accurately what is happening across our community There are billions of posts comments and messages across our services each day and since it s impossible to review all of them we review content once it is reported to us There have been terribly tragic events like suicides some live streamed that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner There are cases of bullying and harassment every day that our team must be alerted to before we can help out These stories show we must find a way to do more Artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach We are researching systems that can look at photos and videos to flag content our team should review This is still very early in development but we have started to have it look at some content and it already generates about one third of all reports to the team that reviews content for our community It will take many years to fully develop these systems Right now we re starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda so we can quickly remove anyone trying to use our services to recruit for a terrorist organization This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide As we discuss keeping our community safe it is important to emphasize that part of keeping people safe is protecting individual security and liberty We are strong advocates of encryption and have built it into the largest messaging platforms in the world WhatsApp and Messenger Keeping our community safe does not require compromising privacy Since building end to end encryption into WhatsApp we have reduced spam and malicious content by more than 75 The path forward is to recognize that a global community needs social infrastructure to keep us safe from threats around the world and that our community is uniquely positioned to prevent disasters help during crises and rebuild afterwards Keeping the global community safe is an important part of our mission and an important part of how we ll measure our progress going forward Informed CommunityThe purpose of any community is to bring people together to do things we couldn t do on our own To do this we need ways to share new ideas and share enough common understanding to actually work together Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality It is our responsibility to amplify the good effects and mitigate the bad to continue increasing diversity while strengthening our common understanding so our community can create the greatest positive impact on the world The two most discussed concerns this past year were about diversity of viewpoints we see filter bubbles and accuracy of information fake news I worry about these and we have studied them extensively but I also worry there are even more powerful effects we must mitigate around sensationalism and polarization leading to a loss of common understanding Social media already provides more diverse viewpoints than traditional media ever has Even if most of our friends are like us we all know people with different interests beliefs and backgrounds who expose us to different perspectives Compared with getting our news from the same two or three TV networks or reading the same newspapers with their consistent editorial views our networks on Facebook show us more diverse content But our goal must be to help people see a more complete picture not just alternate perspectives We must be careful how we do this Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas like showing people an article from the opposite perspective actually deepen polarization by framing other perspectives as foreign A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right Over time our community will identify which sources provide a complete range of perspectives so that content will naturally surface more Accuracy of information is very important We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook and we take this very seriously We ve made progress fighting hoaxes the way we fight spam but we have more work to do We are proceeding carefully because there is not always a clear line between hoaxes satire and opinion In a free society it s important that people have the power to share their opinion even if others think they re wrong Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information including that fact checkers dispute an item s accuracy While we have more work to do on information diversity and misinformation I am even more focused on the impact of sensationalism and polarization and the idea of building common understanding Social media is a short form medium where resonant messages get amplified many times This rewards simplicity and discourages nuance At its best this focuses messages and exposes people to different ideas At its worst it oversimplifies important topics and pushes us towards extremes Polarization exists in all areas of discourse not just social media It occurs in all groups and communities including companies classrooms and juries and it s usually unrelated to politics In the tech community for example discussion around AI has been oversimplified to existential fear mongering The harm is that sensationalism moves people away from balanced nuanced opinions towards polarized extremes If this continues and we lose common understanding then even if we eliminated all misinformation people would just emphasize different sets of facts to fit their polarized opinions That s why I m so worried about sensationalism in media Fortunately there are clear steps we can take to correct these effects For example we noticed some people share stories based on sensational headlines without ever reading the story In general if you become less likely to share a story after reading it that s a good sign the headline was sensational If you re more likely to share a story after reading it that s often a sign of good in depth content We recently started reducing sensationalism in News Feed by taking this into account for pieces of content and going forward signals like this will identify sensational publishers as well There are many steps like this we have taken and will keep taking to reduce sensationalism and help build a more informed community Research suggests the best solutions for improving discourse may come from getting to know each other as whole people instead of just opinions something Facebook may be uniquely suited to do If we connect with people about what we have in common sports teams TV shows interests it is easier to have dialogue about what we disagree on When we do this well we give billions of people the ability to share new perspectives while mitigating the unwanted effects that come with any new medium A strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community Giving people a voice is not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it There is more we must do to support the news industry to make sure this vital social function is sustainable from growing local news to developing formats best suited to mobile devices to improving the range of business models news organizations rely on Connecting everyone to the internet is also necessary for building an informed community For the majority of people around the world the debate is not about the quality of public discourse but whether they have access to basic information they need at all often related to health education and jobs Finally I want to emphasize that the vast majority of conversations on Facebook are social not ideological They re friends sharing jokes and families staying in touch across cities They re people finding groups whether they re new parents raising kids or newly diagnosed patients suffering from a disease together Sometimes it s for joy coming together around religion or sports And sometimes it s for survival like refugees communicating to find shelter Whatever your situation when you enter our community our commitment is to continue improving our tools to give you the power to share your experience By increasing the diversity of our ideas and strengthening our common understanding our community can have the greatest positive impact on the world Civically Engaged CommunityOur society will reflect our collective values only if we engage in the civic process and participate in self governance There are two distinct types of social infrastructure that must be built The first encourages engagement in existing political processes voting engaging with issues and representatives speaking out and sometimes organizing Only through dramatically greater engagement can we ensure these political processes reflect our values The second is establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in collective decision making Our world is more connected than ever and we face global problems that span national boundaries As the largest global community Facebook can explore examples of how community governance might work at scale The starting point for civic engagement in the existing political process is to support voting across the world It is striking that only about half of Americans eligible to vote participate in elections This is low compared to other countries but democracy is receding in many countries and there is a large opportunity across the world to encourage civic participation In the United States election last year we helped more than 2 million people register to vote and then go vote This was among the largest voter turnout efforts in history and larger than those of both major parties combined In every election around the world we keep improving our tools to help more people register and vote and we hope to eventually enable hundreds of millions of more people to vote in elections than do today in every democratic country around the world Local civic engagement is a big opportunity as well as national Today most of us do not even know who our local representatives are but many policies impacting our lives are local and this is where our participation has the greatest influence Research suggests reading local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement This shows how building an informed community supportive local communities and a civically engaged community are all related Beyond voting the greatest opportunity is helping people stay engaged with the issues that matter to them every day not just every few years at the ballot box We can help establish direct dialogue and accountability between people and our elected leaders In India Prime Minister Modi has asked his ministers to share their meetings and information on Facebook so they can hear direct feedback from citizens In Kenya whole villages are in WhatsApp groups together including their representatives In recent campaigns around the world from India and Indonesia across Europe to the United States we ve seen the candidate with the largest and most engaged following on Facebook usually wins Just as TV became the primary medium for civic communication in the 1960s social media is becoming this in the 21st century This creates an opportunity for us to connect with our representatives at all levels In the last few months we have already helped our community double the number of connections between people and our representatives by making it easier to connect with all our representatives in one click When we connect we can engage directly in comments and messages For example in Iceland it s common to tag politicians in group discussions so they can take community issues to parliament Sometimes people must speak out and demonstrate for what they believe is right From Tahrir Square to the Tea Party our community organizes these demonstrations using our infrastructure for events and groups On a daily basis people use their voices to share their views in ways that can spread around the world and grow into movements The Women s March is an example of this where a grandmother with an internet connection wrote a post that led her friends to start a Facebook event that eventually turned into millions of people marching in cities around the world Giving people a voice is a principle our community has been committed to since we began As we look ahead to building the social infrastructure for a global community we will work on building new tools that encourage thoughtful civic engagement Empowering us to use our voices will only become more important Inclusive CommunityBuilding an inclusive global community requires establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in community governance I hope that we can explore examples of how collective decision making might work at scale Facebook is not just technology or media but a community of people That means we need Community Standards that reflect our collective values for what should and should not be allowed In the last year the complexity of the issues we ve seen has outstripped our existing processes for governing the community We saw this in errors taking down newsworthy videos related to Black Lives Matter and police violence and in removing the historical Terror of War photo from Vietnam We ve seen this in misclassifying hate speech in political debates in both directions taking down accounts and content that should be left up and leaving up content that was hateful and should be taken down Both the number of issues and their cultural importance has increased recently This has been painful for me because I often agree with those criticizing us that we re making mistakes These mistakes are almost never because we hold ideological positions at odds with the community but instead are operational scaling issues Our guiding philosophy for the Community Standards is to try to reflect the cultural norms of our community When in doubt we always favor giving people the power to share more There are a few reasons for the increase in issues we ve seen cultural norms are shifting cultures are different around the world and people are sensitive to different things First our community is evolving from its origin connecting us with family and friends to now becoming a source of news and public discourse as well With this cultural shift our Community Standards must adapt to permit more newsworthy and historical content even if some is objectionable For example an extremely violent video of someone dying would have been marked as disturbing and taken down However now that we use Live to capture the news and we post videos to protest violence our standards must adapt Similarly a photo depicting any child nudity would have always been taken down and for good reason but we ve now adapted our standards to allow historically important content like the Terror of War photo These issues reflect a need to update our standards to meet evolving expectations from our community Second our community spans many countries and cultures and the norms are different in each region It s not surprising that Europeans more frequently find fault with taking down images depicting nudity since some European cultures are more accepting of nudity than for example many communities in the Middle East or Asia With a community of almost two billion people it is less feasible to have a single set of standards to govern the entire community so we need to evolve towards a system of more local governance Third even within a given culture we have different opinions on what we want to see and what is objectionable I may be okay with more politically charged speech but not want to see anything sexually suggestive while you may be okay with nudity but not want to see offensive speech Similarly you may want to share a violent video in a protest without worrying that you re going to bother friends who don t want to see it And just as it s a bad experience to see objectionable content it s also a terrible experience to be told we can t share something we feel is important This suggests we need to evolve towards a system of personal control over our experience Fourth we re operating at such a large scale that even a small percent of errors causes a large number of bad experiences We review over one hundred million pieces of content every month and even if our reviewers get 99 of the calls right that s still millions of errors over time Any system will always have some mistakes but I believe we can do better than we are today I ve spent a lot of time over the past year reflecting on how we can improve our community governance Sitting here in California we re not best positioned to identify the cultural norms around the world Instead we need a system where we can all contribute to setting the standards Although this system is not fully developed I want to share an idea of how this might work The guiding principles are that the Community Standards should reflect the cultural norms of our community that each person should see as little objectionable content as possible and each person should be able to share what they want while being told they cannot share something as little as possible The approach is to combine creating a large scale democratic process to determine standards with AI to help enforce them The idea is to give everyone in the community options for how they would like to set the content policy for themselves Where is your line on nudity On violence On graphic content On profanity What you decide will be your personal settings We will periodically ask you these questions to increase participation and so you don t need to dig around to find them For those who don t make a decision the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected like a referendum Of course you will always be free to update your personal settings anytime With a broader range of controls content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow Within that range content should simply not be shown to anyone whose personal controls suggest they would not want to see it or at least they should see a warning first Although we will still block content based on standards and local laws our hope is that this system of personal controls and democratic referenda should minimize restrictions on what we can share It s worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech graphic violence sexually explicit content and more At our current pace of research we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017 but others will not be possible for many years Overall it is important that the governance of our community scales with the complexity and demands of its people We are committed to always doing better even if that involves building a worldwide voting system to give you more voice and control Our hope is that this model provides examples of how collective decision making may work in other aspects of the global community This is an important time in the development of our global community and it s a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive impact History has had many moments like today As we ve made our great leaps from tribes to cities to nations we have always had to build social infrastructure like communities media and governments for us to thrive and reach the next level At each step we learned how to come together to solve our challenges and accomplish greater things than we could alone We have done it before and we will do it again I am reminded of President Lincoln s remarks during the American Civil War We can succeed only by concert It is not can any of us imagine better but can we all do better The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion As our case is new so we must think anew act anew There are many of us who stand for bringing people together and connecting the world I hope we have the focus to take the long view and build the new social infrastructure to create the world we want for generations to come It s an honor to be on this journey with you Thank you for being part of this community and thanks for everything you do to make the world more open
